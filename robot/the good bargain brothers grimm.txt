'' `` well , '' say he to himself , `` they be talk without rhyme or reason , it be seven that I have receive , not eight . '' when he get to the water , he cry to they , `` stupid animal that you be ! do not you know better than that ? it be seven thaler and not eight . '' the frog , however , stand to they , `` aik aik , aik , aik . '' `` come , then , if you will not believe it , I can count it out to you . '' and he take he money out of he pocket and count out the seven thaler , always reckon four and twenty groschen to a thaler . the frog , however , pay no attention to he reckoning , but still cried , `` aik , aik , aik , aik . '' `` what , '' cry the peasant , quite angry , `` since you be determine to know better than I , count it yourselve , '' and throw all the money into the water to they . he stand still and want to wait until they be do and have bring he he own again , but the frog maintain they opinion and cry continually , `` aik , aik , aik , aik , '' and besides that , do not throw the money out again . he still wait a long while until evening come on and he be force to go home . then he abuse the frog and cry , `` you water-splashers , you thick-heads , you goggle-eyes , you have great mouth and can screech till you hurt one 's ear , but you can not count seven thaler ! Do you think I be go to stand here till you get do ? '' and with that he go away , but the frog still cry , `` aik , aik , aik , aik , '' after he till he go home quite angry . after a while he buy another cow , which he kill , and he make the calculation that if he sell the meat well he might gain as much as the two cow be worth , and have the skin into the bargain . when therefore he get to the town with the meat , a great troop of dog be gather together in front of the gate , with a large greyhound at the head of they , which jump at the meat , snuff at it , and bark , `` wow , wow , wow . '' as there be no stop he , the peasant say to he , `` yes , yes , I know quite well that thou art say , ` wow , wow , wow , ' because thou wantest some of the meat ; but I should fare badly if I be to give it to thee . '' the dog , however , answer nothing but `` wow , wow . '' `` wilt thou promise not to devour it all then , and wilt thou go bail for thy companion ? '' `` wow , wow , wow , '' say the dog . `` well , if thou insistest on it , I will leave it for thee ; I know thee well , and know who be thy master ; but this I tell thee , I must have my money in three day or else it will go ill with thee ; thou must just bring it out to I . '' thereupon he unloaded the meat and turn back again , the dog fall upon it and loudly bark , `` wow , wow . '' the countryman , who hear they from afar , say to himself , `` Hark , now they all want some , but the big one be responsible to I for it . '' when three day have pass , the countryman thought , `` to-night my money will be in my pocket , '' and be quite delighted . but no one would come and pay it . `` there be no trust any one now , '' say he ; and at last he lose patience , and go into the town to the butcher and demand he money . the butcher think it be a joke , but the peasant say , `` jest apart , I will have my money ! do not the great dog bring you the whole of the slaughter cow three day ago ? '' then the butcher grow angry , snatch a broomstick and drive he out . `` wait a while , '' say the peasant , `` there be still some justice in the world ! '' and go to the royal palace and beg for a audience . he be lead before the King , who sit there with he daughter , and ask he what injury he have suffer . `` Alas ! '' say he , `` the frog and the dog have take from I what be mine , and the butcher have pay I for it with the stick , '' and he relate at full length all that have happen . Thereupon the King 's daughter begin to laugh heartily , and the King say to he , `` I can not give you justice in this , but you shall have my daughter to wife for it , -- in she whole life she have never yet laugh as she have just do at thee , and I have promise she to he who could make she laugh . Thou mayst thank God for thy good fortune ! '' `` oh , '' answer the peasant , `` I will not have she , I have a wife already , and she be one too many for I ; when I go home , it be just as bad as if I have a wife standing in every corner . '' then the King grow angry , and say , `` Thou art a boor . '' `` ah , Lord King , '' reply the peasant , `` what can you expect from a ox , but beef ? '' `` stop , '' answer the King , `` thou shalt have another reward . be off now , but come back in three day , and then thou shalt have five hundred count out in full . '' when the peasant go out by the gate , the sentry say , `` Thou hast make the King 's daughter laugh , so thou wilt certainly receive something good . '' `` yes , that be what I think , '' answer the peasant ; `` five hundred be to be count out to I . '' `` Hark thee , '' say the soldier , `` give I some of it . what canst thou do with all that money ? '' `` as it be thou , '' say the peasant , `` thou shalt have two hundred ; present thyself in three day ' time before the King , and let it be pay to thee . '' a Jew , who be stand by and have hear the conversation , run after the peasant , hold he by the coat , and say , `` oh , wonder ! what a luck-child thou art ! I will change it for thee , I will change it for thee into small coin , what dost thou want with the great thaler ? '' `` Jew , '' say the countryman , `` three hundred canst thou still have ; give it to I at once in coin , in three day from this , thou wilt be pay for it by the King . '' the Jew be delight with the profit , and bring the sum in bad groschen , three of which be worth two good one . after three day have pass , accord to the King 's command , the peasant go before the King . `` pull he coat off , '' say the latter , `` and he shall have he five hundred . '' `` ah ! '' say the peasant , `` they no longer belong to I ; I present two hundred of they to the sentinel , and three hundred the Jew have change for I , so by right nothing at all belong to I . '' in the meantime the soldier and the Jew enter and claim what they have gain from the peasant , and they receive the blow strictly count out . the soldier bear it patiently and know already how it taste , but the Jew say sorrowfully , `` Alas , alas , be these the heavy thaler ? '' the King could not help laugh at the peasant , and as all he anger be go , he say , `` as thou hast already lose thy reward before it fall to thy lot , I will give thee something in the place of it . go into my treasure chamber and get some money for thyself , as much as thou wilt . '' the peasant do not need to be tell twice , and stuff into he big pocket whatsoever would go in . afterwards he go to a inn and count out he money . the Jew have creep after he and hear how he mutter to himself , `` that rogue of a King have cheat I after all , why could he not have give I the money himself , and then I should have know what I have ? how can I tell now if what I have have the luck to put in my pocket be right or not ? '' `` good heaven ! '' say the Jew to himself , `` that man be speak disrespectfully of we lord the King , I will run and inform , and then I shall get a reward , and he will be punish as well . '' when the King hear of the peasant 's word he fall into a passion , and command the Jew to go and bring the offender to he . the Jew run to the peasant , `` you be to go at once to the lord king in the very clothes you have on . '' `` I know what be right better than that , '' answer the peasant , `` I shall have a new coat make first . Dost thou think that a man with so much money in he pocket be to go there in he ragged old coat ? '' the Jew , as he see that the peasant would not stir without another coat , and as he fear that if the King 's anger cool , he himself would lose he reward , and the peasant he punishment , say , `` I will out of pure friendship lend thee a coat for the short time . what will people not do for love ! '' the peasant be contented with this , put the Jew 's coat on , and go off with he . the King reproach the countryman because of the evil speaking of which the Jew have inform he . `` ah , '' say the peasant , `` what a Jew say be always false -- no true word ever come out of he mouth ! that rascal there be capable of maintain that I have he coat on . '' `` what be that ? '' shriek the Jew . `` be the coat not mine ? Have I not lend it to thee out of pure friendship , in order that thou might appear before the lord king ? '' when the King hear that , he say , `` the Jew have assuredly deceive one or the other of we , either myself or the peasant , '' and again he order something to be count out to he in hard thaler . the peasant , however , go home in the good coat , with the good money in he pocket , and say to himself , `` this time I have hit it !
