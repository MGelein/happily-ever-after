128 the Lazy Spinner BrothersS Grimm in a certain village there once live a man and he wife , and the wife be so idle that she would never work at anything ; whatever she husband give she to spin , she do not get do , and what she do spin she do not wind , but let it all remain entangled in a heap . if the man scold she , she be always ready with she tongue , and say , `` well , how should I wind it , when I have no reel ? just you go into the forest and get I one . '' `` if that be all , '' say the man , `` then I will go into the forest , and get some wood for make reel . '' then the woman be afraid that if he have the wood he would make she a reel of it , and she would have to wind she yarn off , and then begin to spin again . she bethink herself a little , and then a lucky idea occur to she , and she secretly follow the man into the forest , and when he have climb into a tree to choose and cut the wood , she creep into the thicket below where he could not see she , and cry , `` he who cut wood for reel shall die , and he who wind , shall perish . '' the man listen , lay down he axe for a moment , and begin to consider what that could mean . `` Hollo , '' he say at last , `` what can that have be ; my ear must have be sing , I will not alarm myself for nothing . '' so he again seize the axe , and begin to hew , then again there come a cry from below : `` he who cut wood for reel shall die , and he who wind , shall perish . '' he stop , and feel afraid and alarmed , and ponder over the circumstance . but when a few moment have pass , he take heart again , and a third time he stretch out he hand for the axe , and begin to cut . but some one call out a third time , and say loudly , `` he who cut wood for reel shall die , and he who wind , shall perish . '' that be enough for he , and all inclination have depart from he , so he hastily descend the tree , and set out on he way home . the woman run as fast as she could by by-ways so as to get home first . so when he enter the parlor , she put on a innocent look as if nothing have happen , and say , `` well , have you bring a nice piece of wood for reel ? '' `` no , '' say he , `` I see very well that wind will not do , '' and tell she what have happen to he in the forest , and from that time forth leave she in peace about it . neverthless after some time , the man again begin to complain of the disorder in the house . `` wife , '' say he , `` it be really a shame that the spin yarn should lie there all entangled ! '' `` I 'll tell you what , '' say she , `` as we still do not come by any reel , go you up into the loft , and I will stand down below , and will throw the yarn up to you , and you will throw it down to I , and so we shall get a skein after all . '' `` yes , that will do , '' say the man . so they do that , and when it be do , he say , `` the yarn be in skein , now it must be boil . '' the woman be again distressed ; she certainly say , `` yes , we will boil it next morning early . '' but she be secretly contrive another trick . early in the morning she get up , light a fire , and put the kettle on , only instead of the yarn , she put in a lump of tow , and let it boil . after that she go to the man who be still lie in bed , and say to he , `` I must just go out , you must get up and look after the yarn which be in the kettle on the fire , but you must be at hand at once ; mind that , for if the cock should happen to crow , and you be not attend to the yarn , it will become tow . '' the man be willing and take good care not to loiter . he get up as quickly as he could , and go into the kitchen . but when he reach the kettle and peep in , he see , to he horror , nothing but a lump of tow . then the poor man be as still as a mouse , think he have neglect it , and be to blame , and in future say no more about yarn and spinning . but you yourself must own she be a odious woman !
