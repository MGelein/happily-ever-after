'' then she playfellow use to laugh at she and mock she . but one day the King hear she tell they about the beautiful boy she would have when she be marry , and he say to himself he should like very much to have such a son ; the more so that though he have already four Queens he have no child . he go , therefore , to the gardener and tell he he wish to marry he daughter . this delight the gardener and he wife , who think it would indeed be grand for they daughter to become a princess . so they say `` Yes '' to the King , and invite all they friend to the wedding . the King invite all he , and he give the gardener as much money as he want . then the wedding be hold with great feasting and rejoicing . a year later the day draw near on which the gardener 's daughter be to have she son ; and the King 's four other Queens come constantly to see she . one day they say to she , `` the King hunt every day ; and the time be soon come when you will have you child . suppose you fall ill whilst he be out hunting and could therefore know nothing of you illness , what would you do then ? '' when the King come home that evening , the gardener 's daughter say to he , `` every day you go out hunting . should I ever be in trouble or sick while you be away , how could I send for you ? '' the King give she a kettle-drum which he place near the door for she , and he say to she , `` Whenever you want I , beat this kettle-drum . no matter how far away I may be , I shall hear it , and will come at once to you . '' next morning when the King have go out to hunt , he four other Queens come to see the gardener 's daughter . she tell they all about she kettle-drum . `` oh , '' they say , `` do drum on it just to see if the King really will come to you . '' `` no , I will not , '' she say ; `` for why should I call he from he hunting when I do not want he ?

'' `` I want nothing , '' she answer ; `` I only wish to know if you really would come to I when I beat my drum . '' `` very well , '' answer the King ; `` but do not call I again unless you really need I . '' then he return to he hunting . the next day , when the King have go out hunting as usual , the four Queens again come to see the gardener 's daughter . they beg and beg she to beat she drum once more , `` just to see if the King will really come to see you this time . '' at first she refuse , but at last she consent . so she beat she drum , and the King come to she . but when he find she be neither ill nor in trouble , he be angry , and say to she , `` twice I have leave my hunting and lose my game to come to you when you do not need I . now you may call I as much as you like , but I will not come to you , '' and then he go away in a rage . the third day the gardener 's daughter fall ill , and she beat and beat she kettle-drum ; but the King never come . he hear she kettle-drum , but he think , `` she do not really want I ; she be only try to see if I will go to she . '' meanwhile the four other Queens come to she , and they say , `` here it be the custom before a child be bear to bind its mother 's eye with a handkerchief that she may not see it just at first . so let we bind you eye . '' she answer , `` very well , bind my eye . '' the four wife then tie a handkerchief over they . soon after , the gardener 's daughter have a beautiful little son , with a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin , and before the poor mother have see he , the four wicked Queens take the boy to the nurse and say to she , `` now you must not let this child make the least sound for fear he mother should hear he ; and in the night you must either kill he , or else take he away , so that he mother may never see he . if you obey we order , we will give you a great many rupee . '' all this they do out of spite . the nurse take the little child and put he into a box , and the four Queens go back to the gardener 's daughter . first they put a stone into she boy 's little bed , and then they take the handkerchief off she eye and show it she , say , `` look ! this be you son ! '' the poor girl cry bitterly , and think , `` what will the King say when he find no child ? '' but she could do nothing . when the King come home ; he be furious at hear he youngest wife , the gardener 's daughter , have give he a stone instead of the beautiful little son she have promise he . he make she one of the palace servant , and never speak to she . in the middle of the night the nurse take the box in which be the beautiful little prince , and go out to a broad plain in the jungle . there she dig a hole , make the fastening of the box sure , and put the box into the hole , although the child in it be still alive . the King 's dog , whose name be Shankar , have follow she to see what she do with the box . as soon as she have go back to the four Queens -lrb-B- who give she a great many rupee -rrb-B- , the dog go to the hole in which she have put the box , take the box out , and open it . when he see the beautiful little boy , he be very much delighted and say , `` if it please Khuda that this child should live , I will not hurt he ; I will not eat he , but I will swallow he whole and hide he in my stomach . '' this he do . after six month have pass , the dog go by night to the jungle , and think , `` I wonder whether the boy be alive or dead . '' then he bring the child out of he stomach and rejoice over he beauty . the boy be now six month old . when Shankar have caress and love he , he swallow he again for another six month . at the end of that time he go once more by night to the broad jungle-plain . there he bring up the child out of he stomach -lrb-B- the child be now a year old -rrb-B- , and caress and pet he a great deal , and be make very happy by he great beauty . but this time the dog 's keeper have follow and watch the dog ; and he see all that Shankar do , and the beautiful little child , so he run to the four Queens and say to they , `` inside the King 's dog there be a child ! the loveliest child ! he have a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin . such a child have never be see ! '' at this the four wife be very much frightened , and as soon as the King come home from hunting they say to he , `` while you be away you dog come to we room , and tear we clothes and knock about all we thing . we be afraid he will kill we . '' `` do not be afraid , '' say the King . `` eat you dinner and be happy . I will have the dog shot to-morrow morning . '' then he order he servant to shoot the dog at dawn , but the dog hear he , and say to himself , `` what shall I do ? the King intend to kill I . I do not care about that , but what will become of the child if I be kill ? he will die . but I will see if I can not save he . '' so when it be night , the dog run to the King 's cow , who be call Suri , and say to she , `` Suri , I want to give you something , for the King have order I to be shoot to-morrow . Will you take great care of whatever I give you ? '' `` let I see what it be , '' say Suri , `` I will take care of it if I can . '' then they both go together to the wide plain , and there the dog bring up the boy . Suri be enchant with he . `` I never see such a beautiful child in this country , '' she say . `` See , he have a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin . I will take the greatest care of he . '' so say she swallow the little prince . the dog make she a great many salaam , and say , `` to-morrow I shall die ; '' and the cow then go back to she stable . next morning at dawn the dog be take to the jungle and shot . the child now live in Suri 's stomach ; and when one whole year have pass , and he be two year old , the cow go out to the plain , and say to herself , `` I do not know whether the child be alive or dead . but I have never hurt it , so I will see . '' then she bring up the boy ; and he play about , and Suri be delighted ; she love he and caress he , and talk to he . then she swallow he , and return to she stable . at the end of another year she go again to the plain and bring up the child . he play and run about for a hour to she great delight , and she talk to he and caress he . he great beauty make she very happy . then she swallow he once more and return to she stable . the child be now three year old . but this time the cowherd have follow Suri , and have see the wonderful child and all she do to it . so he run and tell the four Queens , `` the King 's cow have a beautiful boy inside she . he have a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin . such a child have never be see before ! '' at this the Queens be terrify . they tear they clothes and they hair and cry . when the King come home at evening , he ask they why they be so agitate . `` oh , '' they say , `` you cow come and try to kill we ; but we run away . she tear we hair and we clothes . '' `` never mind , '' say the King . `` eat you dinner and be happy . the cow shall be kill to-morrow morning . '' now Suri hear the King give this order to the servant , so she say to herself , `` what shall I do to save the child ? '' when it be midnight , she go to the King 's horse call Katar , who be very wicked , and quite untameable . no one have ever be able to ride he ; indeed no one could go near he with safety , he be so savage . Suri say to this horse , `` Katar , will you take care of something that I want to give you , because the King have order I to be kill to-morrow ? '' `` good , '' say Katar ; `` show I what it be . '' then Suri bring up the child , and the horse be delight with he . `` yes , '' he say , `` I will take the greatest care of he . till now no one have be able to ride I , but this child shall ride I . '' then he swallow the boy , and when he have do so , the cow make he many salaam , say , `` it be for this boy 's sake that I be to die . '' the next morning she be take to the jungle and there kill . the beautiful boy now live in the horse 's stomach , and he stay in it for one whole year . at the end of that time the horse thought , `` I will see if this child be alive or dead . '' so he bring he up ; and then he love he , and pet he , and the little prince play all about the stable , out of which the horse be never allow to go . Katar be very glad to see the child , who be now four year old . after he have play for some time , the horse swallow he again . at the end of another year , when the boy be five year old , Katar bring he up again , caress he , love he , and let he play about the stable as he have do a year before . then the horse swallow he again . but this time the groom have see all that happen , and when it be morning , and the King have go away to he hunting , he go to the four wicked Queens , and tell they all he have see , and all about the wonderful , beautiful child that live inside the King 's horse Katar . on hear the groom 's story the four Queens cry , and tear they hair and clothes , and refuse to eat . when the King return at evening and ask they why they be so miserable , they say , `` you horse Katar come and tear we clothes , and upset all we thing , and we run away for fear he should kill we . '' `` never mind , '' say the King . `` only eat you dinner and be happy . I will have Katar shot to-morrow . '' then he think that two man unaided could not kill such a wicked horse , so he order he servant to bid he troop of sepoy shoot he . so the next day the King place he sepoy all round the stable , and he take up he stand with they ; and he say he would himself shoot any one who let he horse escape . meanwhile the horse have overhear all these order . so he bring up the child and say to he , `` go into that little room that lead out of the stable , and you will find in it a saddle and bridle which you must put on I . then you will find in the room some beautiful clothes such as prince wear ; these you must put on yourself ; and you must take the sword and gun you will find there too . then you must mount on my back . '' now Katar be a fairy-horse , and come from the fairy ' country , so he could get anything he want ; but neither the King nor any of he people know this . when all be ready , katar burst out of he stable , with the prince on he back , rush past the King himself before the King have time to shoot he , gallop away to the great jungle-plain , and gallop about all over it . the King see he horse have a boy on he back , though he could not see the boy distinctly . the sepoy try in vain to shoot the horse ; he gallop much too fast ; and at last they be all scatter over the plain . then the King have to give it up and go home ; and the sepoy go to they home . the King could not shoot any of he sepoy for let he horse escape , for he himself have let he do so . then Katar gallop away , on , and on , and on ; and when night come they stay under a tree , he and the King 's son . the horse eat grass , and the boy wild fruit which he find in the jungle . next morning they start afresh , and go far , and far , till they come to a jungle in another country , which do not belong to the little prince 's father , but to another king . here Katar say to the boy , `` now get off my back . '' off jump the prince . `` Unsaddle I and take off my bridle ; take off you beautiful clothes and tie they all up in a bundle with you sword and gun . '' this the boy do . then the horse give he some poor , common clothes , which he tell he to put on . as soon as he be dress in they the horse say , `` hide you bundle in this grass , and I will take care of it for you . I will always stay in this jungle-plain , so that when you want I you will always find I . you must now go away and find service with some one in this country . '' this make the boy very sad . `` I know nothing about anything , '' he say . `` what shall I do all alone in this country ? '' `` do not be afraid , '' answer Katar . `` you will find service , and I will always stay here to help you when you want I . so go , only before you go , twist my right ear . '' the boy do so , and he horse instantly become a donkey . `` now twist you right ear , '' say Katar . and when the boy have twist it , he be no longer a handsome prince , but a poor , common - look , ugly man ; and he moon and star be hide . then he go away further into the country , until he come to a grain merchant of the country , who ask he who he be . `` I be a poor man , '' answer the boy , `` and I want service . '' `` good , '' say the grain merchant , `` you shall be my servant . '' now the grain merchant live near the King 's palace , and one night at twelve o'clock the boy be very hot ; so he go out into the King 's cool garden , and begin to sing a lovely song . the seventh and youngest daughter of the King hear he , and she wonder who it be who could sing so deliciously . then she put on she clothes , roll up she hair , and come down to where the seemingly poor common man be lie singing . `` who be you ? where do you come from ? '' she ask . but he answer nothing . `` who be this man who do not answer when I speak to he ? '' think the little princess , and she go away . on the second night the same thing happen , and on the third night too . but on the third night , when she find she could not make he answer she , she say to he , `` what a strange man you be not to answer I when I speak to you . '' but still he remain silent , so she go away . the next day , when he have finish he work , the young prince go to the jungle to see he horse , who ask he , `` be you quite well and happy ? '' `` yes , I be , '' answer the boy . `` I be servant to a grain merchant . the last three night I have go into the King 's garden and sing a song , and each night the youngest princess have come to I and ask I who I be , and whence I come , and I have answer nothing . what shall I do now ? '' the horse say , `` next time she ask you who you be , tell she you be a very poor man , and come from you own country to find service here . '' the boy then go home to the grain merchant , and at night , when every one have go to bed , he go to the King 's garden and sing he sweet song again . the youngest princess hear he , get up , dress , and come to he . `` who be you ? Whence do you come ? '' she ask . `` I be a very poor man , '' he answer . `` I come from my own country to seek service here , and I be now one of the grain merchant 's servant . '' then she go away . for three more night the boy sing in the King 's garden , and each night the princess come and ask he the same question as before , and the boy give she the same answer . then she go to she father , and say to he , `` Father , I wish to be marry ; but I must choose my husband myself . '' she father consent to this , and he write and invite all the KingsS and RajasS in the land , say , `` my youngest daughter wish to be marry , but she insist on choose she husband herself . as I do not know who it be she wish to marry , I beg you will all come on a certain day , for she to see you and make she choice . '' a great many KingsS , RajasS , and they son accept this invitation and come . when they have all arrive , the little princess 's father say to they , `` to-morrow morning you must all sit together in my garden '' -lrb-B- the King 's garden be very large -rrb-B- , `` for then my youngest daughter will come and see you all , and choose she husband . I do not know whom she will choose . '' the youngest princess order a grand elephant to be ready for she the next morning , and when the morning come , and all be ready , she dress herself in the most lovely clothes , and put on she beautiful jewel ; then she mount she elephant , which be paint blue . in she hand she take a gold necklace . then she go into the garden where the KingsS , RajasS , and they son be seat . the boy , the grain merchant 's servant , be also in the garden : not as a suitor , but look on with the other servant . the princess ride all round the garden , and look at all the KingsS and RajasS and prince , and then she hang the gold necklace round the neck of the boy , the grain merchant 's servant . at this everybody laugh , and the KingsS be greatly astonish . but then they and the Rajas say , `` what fooling be this ? '' and they push the pretended poor man away , and take the necklace off he neck , and say to he , `` get out of the way , you poor , dirty man . you clothes be far too dirty for you to come near we ! '' the boy go far away from they , and stand a long way off to see what would happen . then the King 's youngest daughter go all round the garagain , hold she gold necklace in she hand , and once more she hang it round the boy 's neck . every one laugh at she and say , `` how can the King 's daughter think of marry this poor , common man ! '' and the KingsS and the Rajas , who have come as suitor , all want to turn he out of the garden . but the princess say , `` take care ! take care ! you must not turn he out . leave he alone . '' then she put he on she elephant , and take he to the palace . the KingsS and RajasS and they son be very much astonished , and say , `` what do this mean ? the princess do not care to marry one of we , but choose that very poor man ! '' she father then stand up , and say to they all , `` I promise my daughter she should marry any one she please , and as she have twice choose that poor , common man , she shall marry he . '' and so the princess and the boy be marry with great pomp and splendor : she father and mother be quite content with she choice ; and the KingsS , the Rajas and they son , all return to they home . now the princess 's six sister have all married rich prince , and they laugh at she for choose such a poor ugly husband as hers seem to be , and say to each other , mockingly , `` see ! we sister have marry this poor , common man ! '' they six husband use to go out hunting every day , and every evening they bring home quantity of all kind of game to they wife , and the game be cook for they dinner and for the King 's ; but the husband of the youngest princess always stay at home in the palace , and never go out hunting at all . this make she very sad , and she say to herself , `` my sister ' husband hunt every day , but my husband never hunt at all . '' at last she say to he , `` why do you never go out hunting as my sister ' husband do every day , and every day they bring home quantity of all kind of game ? why do you always stay at home , instead of do as they do ? '' one day he say to she , `` I be go out to-day to eat the air . '' `` very good , '' she answer ; `` go , and take one of the horse . '' `` no , '' say the young prince , `` I will not ride , I will walk . '' then he go to the jungle-plain where he have leave Katar , who all this time have seem to be a donkey , and he tell Katar everything . `` listen , '' he say ; `` I have marry the youngest princess ; and when we be married everybody laugh at she for choose I , and say , ` what a very poor , common man we princess have choose for she husband ! ' besides , my wife be very sad , for she six sister ' husband all hunt every day , and bring home quantity of game , and they wife therefore be very proud of they . but I stay at home all day , and never hunt . to-day I should like to hunt very much . '' `` well , '' say Katar , `` then twist my left ear ; '' and as soon as the boy have twist it , Katar be a horse again , and not a donkey any longer . `` now , '' say Katar , `` twist you left ear , and you will see what a beautiful young prince you will become . '' so the boy twist he own left ear , and there he stand no longer a poor , common , ugly man , but a grand young prince with a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin . then he put on he splendid clothes , saddle and bridle Katar , get on he back with he sword and gun , and ride off to hunt . he ride very far , and shoot a great many bird and a quantity of deer . that day he six brother-in-law could find no game , for the beautiful young prince have shoot it all . nearly all the day long these six prince wander about look in vain for game ; till at last they grow hungry and thirsty , and could find no water , and they have no food with they . meanwhile the beautiful young prince have sit down under a tree , to dine and rest , and there he six brother-in-law find he . by he side be some delicious water , and also some roast meat . when they see he the six prince say to each other , `` look at that handsome prince . he have a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin . we have never see such a prince in this jungle before ; he must come from another country . '' then they come up to he , and make he many salaam , and beg he to give they some food and water . `` who be you ? '' say the young prince . `` we be the husband of the six elder daughter of the King of this country , '' they answer ; `` and we have hunt all day , and be very hungry and thirsty . '' they do not recognize they brother-in-law in the least . `` well , '' say the young prince , `` I will give you something to eat and drink if you will do as I bid you . '' `` we will do all you tell we to do , '' they answer , `` for if we do not get water to drink , we shall die . '' `` very good , '' say the young prince . `` now you must let I put a red-hot pice on the back of each of you , and then I will give you food and water . Do you agree to this ? '' the six prince consent , for they think , `` no one will ever see the mark of the pice , as it will be cover by we clothes ; and we shall die if we have no water to drink . '' then the young prince take six pice , and make they red-hot in the fire ; he lay one on the back of each of the six prince , and give they good food and water . they eat and drank ; and when they have finish they make he many salaam and go home . the young prince stay under the tree till it be evening ; then he mount he horse and ride off to the King 's palace . all the people look at he as he come ride along , say , `` what a splendid young prince that be ! he have a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin . '' but no one recognize he . when he come near the King 's palace , all the King 's servant ask he who he be ; and as none of they know he , the gate-keepers would not let he pass in . they all wonder who he could be , and all think he the most beautiful prince that have ever be see . at last they ask he who he be . `` I be the husband of you youngest princess , '' he answer . `` no , no , indeed you be not , '' they say ; `` for he be a poor , common - look , and ugly man . '' `` but I be he , '' answer the prince ; only no one would believe he . `` tell we the truth , '' say the servant ; `` who be you ? '' `` perhaps you can not recognize I , '' say the young prince , `` but call the youngest princess here . I wish to speak to she . '' the servant call she , and she come . `` that man be not my husband , '' she say at once . `` my husband be not nearly as handsome as that man . this must be a prince from another country . '' then she say to he , `` who be you ? why do you say you be my husband ? '' `` because I be you husband . I be tell you the truth , '' answer the young prince . `` no you be not , you be not tell I the truth , '' say the little princess . `` my husband be not a handsome man like you . I marry a very poor , common-looking man . '' `` that be true , '' he answer , `` but nevertheless I be you husband . I be the grain merchant 's servant ; and one hot night I go into you father 's garden and sing , and you hear I , and come and ask I who I be and where I come from , and I would not answer you . and the same thing happen the next night , and the next , and on the fourth I tell you I be a very poor man , and have come from my country to seek service in yours , and that I be the grain merchant 's servant . then you tell you father you wish to marry , but must choose you own husband ; and when all the KingsS and RajasS be seat in you father 's garden , you sit on a elephant and go round and look at they all ; and then twice hung you gold necklace round my neck , and choose I . See , here be you necklace , and here be the ring and the handkerchief you give I on we wedding day . '' then she believe he , and be very glad that she husband be such a beautiful young prince . `` what a strange man you be ! '' she say to he . `` till now you have be poor , and ugly , and common-looking . now you be beautiful and look like a prince ; I never see such a handsome man as you be before ; and yet I know you must be my husband . '' then she worship God and thank he for let she have such a husband . `` I have , '' she say , `` a beautiful husband . there be no one like he in this country . he have a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin . '' then she take he into the palace , and show he to she father and mother and to every one . they all say they have never see any one like he , and be all very happy . and the young prince live as before in the King 's palace with he wife , and Katar live in the King 's stable . one day , when the King and he seven son-in-law be in he court - house , and it be full of people , the young prince say to he , `` there be six thief here in you court-house . '' `` six thief ! '' say the King . `` where be they ? Show they to I . '' `` there they be , '' say the young prince , point to he six brother-in-law . the King and every one else in the court-house be very much astonished , and would not believe the young prince . `` take off they coat , '' he say , `` and then you will see for yourselve that each of they have the mark of a thief on he back . '' so they coat be take off the six prince , and the King and everybody in the court-house see the mark of the red-hot pice . the six prince be very much ashamed , but the young prince be very glad . he have not forget how he brother-in-law have laugh at he and mock he when he seem a poor , common man . now , when Katar be still in the jungle , before the prince be marry , he have tell the boy the whole story of he birth , and all that have happen to he and he mother . `` when you be marry , '' he say to he , `` I will take you back to you father 's country . '' so two month after the young prince have revenge himself on he brother-in-law , Katar say to he , `` it be time for you to return to you father . get the King to let you go to you own country , and I will tell you what to do when we get there . '' the prince always do what he horse tell he to do ; so he go to he wife and say to she , `` I wish very much to go to my own country to see my father and mother . '' `` very well , '' say he wife ; `` I will tell my father and mother , and ask they to let we go . '' then she go to they , and tell they , and they consent to let she and she husband leave they . the King give he daughter and the young prince a great many horse , and elephant , and all sort of present , and also a great many sepoy to guard they . in this grand state they travel to the prince 's country , which be not a great many mile off . when they reach it they pitch they tent on the same plain in which the prince have be leave in he box by the nurse , where Shankar and Suri have swallow he so often . when the King , he father , the gardener 's daughter 's husband , see the prince 's camp , he be very much alarmed , and think a great King have come to make war on he . he send one of he servant , therefore , to ask whose camp it be . the young prince then write he a letter , in which he say , `` you be a great king . do not fear I . I be not come to make war on you . I be as if I be you son . I be a prince who have come to see you country and to speak with you . I wish to give you a grand feast , to which every one in you country must come -- man and woman , old and young , rich and poor , of all caste ; all the child , fakir , and sepoy . you must bring they all here to I for a week , and I will feast they all . '' the King be delight with this letter , and order all the man , woman , and child of all caste , fakir , and sepoy , in he country to go to the prince 's camp to a grand feast the prince would give they . so they all come , and the King bring he four wife too . all come , at least all but the gardener 's daughter . no one have tell she to go to the feast , for no one have think of she . when all the people be assemble , the prince see he mother be not there , and he ask the King , `` have every one in you country come to my feast ? '' `` yes , every one , '' say the King . `` be you sure of that ? '' ask the prince . `` quite sure , '' answer the King . `` I be sure one woman have not come , '' say the prince . `` she be you gardener 's daughter , who be once you wife and be now a servant in you palace . '' `` true , '' say the King , `` I have forget she . '' then the prince tell he servant to take he finest palanquin and to fetch the gardener 's daughter . they be to bathe she , dress she in beautiful clothes and handsome jewel , and then bring she to he in the palanquin . while the servant be bring the gardener 's daughter , the King think how handsome the young prince be ; and he notice particularly the moon on he forehead and the star on he chin , and he wonder in what country the young prince be bear . and now the palanquin arrive bring the gardener 's daughter , and the young prince go himself and take she out of it , and bring she into the tent . he make she a great many salaam . the four wicked wife look on and be very much surprised and very angry . they remember that , when they arrive , the prince have make they no salaam , and since then have not take the least notice of they ; whereas he could not do enough for the gardener 's daughter , and seem very glad to see she . when they be all at dinner , the prince again make the gardener 's daughter a great many salaam , and give she food from all the nicest dish . she wonder at he kindness to she , and think , `` who be this handsome prince , with a moon on he forehead and a star on he chin ?
