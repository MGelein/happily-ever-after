'' `` a fish laugh ! impossible ! you must be dream . '' `` I be not a fool . I speak of what I have see with my own eye and have hear with my own ear . '' `` pass strange ! be it so . I will inquire concern it . '' on the morrow the king repeat to he vizier what he wife have tell he , and bid he investigate the matter , and be ready with a satisfactory answer within six month , on pain of death . the vizier promise to do he best , though he feel almost certain of failure . for five month he labor indefatigably to find a reason for the laughter of the fish . he seek everywhere and from every one . the wise and learn , and they who be skilled in magic and in all manner of trickery , be consult . nobody , however , could explain the matter ; and so he return broken-hearted to he house , and begin to arrange he affair in prospect of certain death , for he have have sufficient experience of the king to know that he Majesty would not go back from he threat . amongst other thing , he advise he son to travel for a time , until the king 's anger should have somewhat cool . the young fellow , who be both clever and handsome , start off whithersoever Kismat might lead he . he have be go some day , when he fall in with a old farmer , who also be on a journey to a certain village . find the old man very pleasant , he ask he if he might accompany he , profess to be on a visit to the same place . the old farmer agree , and they walk along together . the day be hot , and the way be long and weary . `` do not you think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes give one another a lift ? '' say the youth . `` what a fool the man be ! '' think the old farmer . presently they pass through a field of corn ready for the sickle , and look like a sea of gold as it wave to and fro in the breeze . `` be this eat or not ? '' say the young man . not understand he meaning , the old man reply , `` I do not know . '' after a little while the two traveller arrive at a big village , where the young man give he companion a clasp-knife , and say , `` take this , friend , and get two horse with it ; but mind and bring it back , for it be very precious . '' the old man , look half amuse and half angry , push back the knife , mutter something to the effect that he friend be either a fool himself or else try to play the fool with he . the young man pretend not to notice he reply , and remain almost silent till they reach the city , a short distance outside which be the old farmer 's house . they walk about the bazar and go to the mosque , but nobody salute they or invite they to come in and rest . `` what a large cemetery ! '' exclaim the young man . `` what do the man mean , '' think the old farmer , `` call this largely populated city a cemetery ? '' on leave the city they way lead through a cemetery where a few people be pray beside a grave and distribute chapati and kulcha to passer-by , in the name of they beloved dead . they beckon to the two traveller and give they as much as they would . `` what a splendid city this be ! '' say the young man . `` now , the man must surely be dement ! '' think the old farmer . `` I wonder what he will do next ? he will be call the land water , and the water land ; and be speak of light where there be darkness , and of darkness when it be light . '' however , he keep he thought to himself . presently they have to wade through a stream that run along the edge of the cemetery . the water be rather deep , so the old farmer take of he shoe and paijama and cross over ; but the young man wade through it with he shoe and paijama on . `` well ! I never do see such a perfect fool , both in word and in deed , '' say the old man to himself . however , he like the fellow ; and think that he would amuse he wife and daughter , he invite he to come and stay at he house as long as he have occasion to remain in the village . `` thank you very much , '' the young man reply ; `` but let I first inquire , if you please , whether the beam of you house be strong . '' the old farmer leave he in despair , and enter he house laugh . `` there be a man in yonder field , '' he say , after return they greeting . `` he have come the greater part of the way with I , and I want he to put up here as long as he have to stay in this village . but the fellow be such a fool that I can not make anything out of he . he want to know if the beam of this house be all right . the man must be mad ! '' and say this , he burst into a fit of laughter . `` Father , '' say the farmer 's daughter , who be a very sharp and wise girl , `` this man , whosoever he be , be no fool , as you deem he . he only wish to know if you can afford to entertain he . '' `` oh ! of course , '' reply the farmer . `` I see . well perhaps you can help I to solve some of he other mystery . while we be walk together he ask whether he should carry I or I should carry he , as he think that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding . '' `` most assuredly , '' say the girl . `` he mean that one of you should tell a story to beguile the time . '' `` oh yes . well , we be pass through a corn-field , when he ask I whether it be eat or not . '' `` and do not you know the meaning of this , father ? he simply wish to know if the man be in debt or not ; because , if the owner of the field be in debt , then the produce of the field be as good as eat to he ; that be , it would have to go to he creditor . '' `` yes , yes , yes ; of course ! then , on enter a certain village , he bid I take he clasp knife and get two horse with it , and bring back the knife again to he . '' `` be not two stout stick as good as two horse for help one along on the road ? he only ask you to cut a couple of stick and be careful not to lose he knife . '' `` I see , '' say the farmer . `` while we be walk over the city we do not see anybody that we know , and not a soul give we a scrap of anything to eat , till we be pass the cemetery ; but there some people call to we and put into we hand some chapati and kulcha ; so my companion call the city a cemetery , and the cemetery a city . '' `` this also be to be understand , father , if one think of the city as the place where everything be to be obtain , and of inhospitable people as worse than the dead . the city , though crowd with people , be as if dead , as far as you be concern ; while , in the cemetery , which be crowd with the dead , you be salute by kind friend and provide with bread . '' `` true , true ! '' say the astonished farmer . `` then , just now , when we be cross the stream , he wade through it without take off he shoe and paijama . '' `` I admire he wisdom , '' reply the girl . `` I have often think how stupid people be to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and over those sharp stone with bare foot . the slightest stumble and they would fall , and be wet from head to foot . this friend of yours be a most wise man . I should like to see he and speak to he . '' `` very well , '' say the farmer ; `` I will go and find he , and bring he in . '' `` tell he , father , that we beam be strong enough , and then he will come in . I 'll send on ahead a present to the man , to show he that we can afford to have he for we guest . '' accordingly she call a servant and send he to the young man with a present of a basin of ghee , twelve chapati , and a jar of milk , and the following message : -- `` o friend , the moon be full ; twelve month make a year , and the sea be overflow with water . '' half-way the bearer of this present and message meet he little son , who , see what be in the basket , beg he father to give he some of the food . he father foolishly comply . presently he see the young man , and give he the rest of the present and the message . `` give you mistress my salam , '' he reply , `` and tell she that the moon be new , and that I can only find eleven month in the year , and the sea be by no means full . '' not understand the meaning of these word , the servant repeat they word for word , as he have hear they , to he mistress ; and thus he theft be discover , and he be severely punish . after a little while the young man appear with the old farmer . great attention be show to he , and he be treat in every way as if he be the son of a great man , although he humble host know nothing of he origin . at length he tell they everything -- about the laughing of the fish , he father 's threatened execution , and he own banishment -- and ask they advice as to what he should do . `` the laughing of the fish , '' say the girl , `` which seem to have be the cause of all this trouble , indicate that there be a man in the palace who be plot against the king 's life . '' `` Joy , joy ! '' exclaim the vizier 's son . `` there be yet time for I to return and save my father from a ignominious and unjust death , and the king from danger . '' the following day he hasten back to he own country , take with he the farmer 's daughter . immediately on arrival he run to the palace and inform he father of what he have hear . the poor vizier , now almost dead from the expectation of death , be at once carry to the king , to whom he repeat the news that he son have just bring . `` never ! '' say the king . `` but it must be so , you Majesty , '' reply the vizier ; `` and in order to prove the truth of what I have hear , I pray you to call together all the maid in you palace , and order they to jump over a pit , which must be dig . we 'll soon find out whether there be any man there . '' the king have the pit dig , and command all the maid belong to the palace to try to jump it . all of they try , but only one succeed . that one be find to be a man ! ! thus be the queen satisfy , and the faithful old vizier save . afterwards , as soon as could be , the vizier 's son marry the old farmer 's daughter ; and a most happy marriage it be .
