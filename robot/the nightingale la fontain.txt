the NIGHTINGALE La Fontain no easy matter ` ti to hold , against its owner 's will , the fleece who trouble by the itch smart of Cupid 's irritate dart , Eager await some Jason bold to grant release . E ` en dragon huge , or flame steer , when Jason 's love will cause no fear . Duennas , grating , bolt and lock , all obstacle can naught avail ; Constraint be but a stumbling block ; for youthful ardor must prevail . girl be precocious nowadays , look at the man with ardent gaze , and longing ' a infinity ; Trim miss but just in they teens by day and night devise the means to dull with subtlety to sleep the Argus vainly set to keep in safety they virginity . sigh , smile , false tear , they 'll fain employ a artless lover to decoy . I 'll say no more , but leave to you , friend reader , to pronounce if true what I have assert when you have hear how artful Kitty , cage she bird . in a small town in Italy , the name of which I do not know , Young Kitty dwelt , gay , pretty , free , Varambon 's child . -- Boccacio omit she mother 's name , which not to you or I import a jot . at fourteen year we Kitty 's charm be all that could be wish -- plump arm , a swell bosom ; on she cheek RosesS ' and lily ' mingled streak , a sparkling eye -- all these , you know , speak well for what be find below . with such advantage as these no virgin sure could fail to please , or lack a lover ; nor do Kate ; but little time she have to wait ; one soon appear to seal she fate . Young Richard see she , love she , woo she -- what swain I ask could have withstand she ? soft word , caress , tender glance , the battery of love 's advance , soon light up in the maiden 's breast the flame which he own heart possess , soon grow to a burning fire of love and mutual desire . desire for what ? my reader know , or if he do not may suppose , and not be very wond ` rous wise . when youthful lover mingle sigh , Believe I , friend , I be not wrong , for one thing only do they long . one check defer we lover 's bliss , a thing quite natural , 'twa this : the mother love so well she child that , fearful she might be beguile , she would not let she out of sight , a single minute , day or night . at mother 's apron string all day Kate while the weary hour away , and share she bed all night . such love in parent we must all approve , though Catherine , I must confess , in place of so much tenderness more liberty would have prefer . to little girl maternal care in such excess be right and fair , but for a lass of fourteen year , for whom one need have no such fear , Solicitude be quite absurd , and only bore she . kitty could no moment steal , do what she would , to see she Richard . sorely vex she be , and he still more perplexed . in spite of all he might devise a squeeze , a kiss , quick talk of eye be all he could obtain , no more . bread butterless , a sanded floor , it seem no better . Joy like this could not suffice , more sterling bliss we lover wish , nor would stop short till they would obtain the thing they seek . and thus it come about . one day by chance they meet , alone , away from jealous parent . `` what be the use ; '' Said Richard , `` of all we affection ? `` of love it be a rank abuse , `` and yield I nothing but dejection `` I see you without see you , `` must always look another way , `` and if we meet I dare not stay , `` must ev ` ry inclination smother . `` I can not believe you love be true ; `` I 'll never own you really kind `` unless some certain means you find `` for we to meet without you mother . '' Kate answer : `` be it not too plain `` how warm my love , another strain `` I would employ . in converse vain `` let we not waste we moment few ; `` but think what it be best to do . '' `` if you will please I , '' Robert say , `` you must contrive to change you bed , `` and have it place -- well , let I see -- `` move to the outer gallery , `` where you will be alone and free . `` we there can meet and chat at leisure `` while other sleep , nor need we fear , `` of merry tale I have a treasure `` to tell , but can not tell they here . '' Kate smile at this for she know well what sort of tale he have to tell ; but promise she would do she best and soon accomplish he request . it be not easy , you 'll admit , but love lend foolish maiden wit ; and this be how she manage it . the whole night long she keep awake , Snored , sigh and kick , as one possess , that parent both could get not rest , so much she make the settle shake . this be not strange . a longing girl , with thought of sweetheart in she head , in bed all night will sleepless twirl . a flea be in she ear , ` ti say . the morning break . of flea and heat kitty complain . `` let I entreat , `` o mother , I may put my bed `` out in the gallery , '' she say , '' ` Tis cooler there , and Philomel `` who warble in the neigh ` bring dell `` Will solace I . '' ready consent the simple mother give , and go to seek she spouse . `` we Kate , my dear , `` will change she bed that she may hear `` the nightingale , and sleep more cool . '' `` wife , '' say the good man , `` you be a fool , `` and Kate too with she nightingale ; `` do not tell I such a foolish tale . `` she must remain . no doubt to-night `` Will fresher be . I sleep all right `` in spite of heat , and so can she . `` be she more delicate than I ? '' incense be Kate by this denial after so promise a trial , nor would be beat , but firmly swear to give more trouble than before . that night again no wink she sleep but groan and fret , sigh and weep , upon she couch so toss and turn , the anxious mother quite concerned Again she husband seek . `` we Kate `` to I seem greatly change of late . `` you be unkind , '' she say to he , `` to thwart she simple , girlish whim . `` why may she not she bed exchange , `` in naught will it the house derange ? `` place in the passage she be as near `` to we as be she lie here . `` you do not love you child , and will `` with you unkindness make she ill. '' `` pray cease , '' the husband cry , `` to scold `` and take you whim . I ne'er could hold `` my own against a scream wife ; `` you 'll drive I mad , upon my life . `` she belly-full we Kate may get `` of nightingale or of linnet . '' the thing be settle . Kate obey , and in a trice she bed be make , and lover signal . who shall say how long to both appear that day , that tedious day ! but night arrive and Richard too ; he have contrived by ladder , and a servant 's aid , to reach the chamber of the maid . to tell how often they embrace , how change in form they tenderness , would lead to nothing but a waste of time , my reader will confess . the longest , most abstruse discourse would lack precision , want the force they youthful ardor to portray . to understand there be but one way -- experience . the nightingale Sang all night long he please tale , and though he make but little noise , the lass be satisfy . she joy so exquisite that she aver the other nightingale , the bird who warble to the wood he bliss , be but a ass compare with this . but nature could not long maintain of effort such as these the strain ; they force spend , the lover twain in fond embrace fall fast asleep just as the dawn begin to peep : the father as he leave he bed by curiosity be lead to learn if Kitty soundly sleep , and softly to the passage creep . `` I 'll see the influence , '' he say , `` of nightingale and change of bed . '' with bated breath , upon tip toe , close to the couch he cautious go where Kitty lay in calm repose . excessive heat have make all clothes unbearable . the sleep pair have cast they off , and lay as bare as we first happy parent be in Paradise . but in the place of apple , in she willing hand Kate firmly grasp the magic wand which serve to find the human race , the which to name be a disgrace , Though dame the most refined employ it ; Desire it , and much enjoy it , if good catullus tell we true . the father scarce believe he view , but keep in he bosom pent he anger , to he wife he go , and say , `` get up , and come with I . `` at present I can plainly see `` why Kate have such anxiety `` to hear the nightingale , for she `` to catch the bird so well have plan `` that now she hold he in she hand . '' the mother almost weep for glee . `` a nightingale , oh ! let I see . `` how large be he , and can he sing , `` and will he breed , the pretty thing ? `` how do she catch he , clever child ? '' despite he grief the good man smile . `` much more than you expect you 'll see . `` but hold you tongue , and come with I ; `` for if you chattering be hear , `` away will fly the timid bird ; `` and you will spoil we daughter 's game . '' who be surprise ? it be the dame . she anger burst into a flame as she the nightingale espied which Kitty hold ; she could have cry , and scold , call she nasty slut , and brazen hussey , bitch , and -- but she husband stop she . `` what be the use `` of all you scolding and abuse ? `` the mischief 's do , in vain may you `` from now till doomsday fret and stew , `` misfortune do you can not undo , `` but something may be do to mend : `` for notary this instant send , `` bid holy priest and mayor attend . `` for they good office I wait `` to set this nasty matter straight . '' as he discourse , Richard awake , and see that the sun have break , these troubled word to Kitty speak `` Alas , my love , ` tis broad day light , `` how can I now effect my flight ? '' `` all will go well , '' rejoin the sire , `` I will not grumble , my just ire `` be useless here ; you have commit `` a wrong of which to be acquit , `` Richard , there be one only way , `` my child you wed without delay . `` she be well bring up , young , full of health `` if fortune have not grant wealth , `` she beauty you do not deny , `` so wed she , or prepare to die . '' to hesitate in such a case would surely have be out of place the girl he love to take to wife , or in he prime to lose he life , the point in truth need no debate , nor do we Richard hesitate . besides , the most supreme delight of life he have taste one short night , but one , in lovely Kitty 's arm ; could he so soon resign she charm ! while Richard , please with he escape from what he fear a awkward scrape , be dream of he happy choice , we kitty , by she father 's voice awaken , from she hand let go the cause of all she joy and woe , and round she naked beauty wind the sheet pick up from off the ground : meanwhile the notary appear to put a end to all they fear . they write , they sign , the seal -- and thus the wedding end free from fuss . they leave the happy couple there . he satisfaction to declare , thus speak they father to the pair : `` take courage , child , have no care ; `` the nightingale in cage be pent , `` May sing now to he heart 's content .
