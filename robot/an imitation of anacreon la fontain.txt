a imitation of ANACREON La Fontain PAINTER in Paphos and Cythera fame Depict , I pray , the absent Iris ' face . Thou hast not see the lovely nymph I have name ; the better for thy peace . -- then will I trace for thy instruction she transcendent grace . begin with lily white and blush rise , take then the love and grace ... but what good word , idle word ? for beauty 's goddess could by Iris be replace , nor one suppose the secret fraud -- they grace so equal show . Thou at Cythera couldst , at Paphos too , of the same Iris Venus form anew .
