'' the goat answer , `` I have eat so much , not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh ! '' `` come home , then , '' say the youth , and take hold of the cord round she neck , lead she into the stable and tie she up securely . `` well , '' say the old tailor , `` have the goat have as much food as she ought ? '' `` oh , '' answer the son , `` she have eat so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch . '' but the father wish to satisfy himself , and go down to the stable , stroke the dear animal and ask , `` Goat , art thou satisfy ? '' the goat answer , `` wherewithal should I be satisfy ? among the grave I leap about , and find no food , so go without , meh ! meh ! '' `` what do I hear ? '' cry the tailor , and run upstairs and say to the youth , `` Hollo , thou liar : thou saidest the goat have have enough , and hast let she hunger ! '' and in he anger he take the yard-measure from the wall , and drive he out with blow . next day it be the turn of the second son , who look out for a place in the fence of the garden , where nothing but good herb grow , and the goat clear they all off . at night when he want to go home , he ask , `` Goat , art thou satisfy ? '' the goat answer , `` I have eat so much , not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh ! '' `` come home , then , '' say the youth , and lead she home , and tie she up in the stable . `` well , '' say the old tailor , `` have the goat have as much food as she ought ? '' `` oh , '' answer the son , `` she have eat so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch . '' the tailor would not rely on this , but go down to the stable and say , `` Goat , hast thou have enough ? '' the goat answer , `` wherewithal should I be satisfy ? among the grave I leap about , and find no food , so go without , meh ! meh ! '' `` the godless wretch ! '' cry the tailor , `` to let such a good animal hunger , '' and he run up and drive the youth out of door with the yard-measure . now come the turn of the third son , who want to do the thing well , and seek out some bush with the finest leaf , and let the goat devour they . in the evening when he want to go home , he ask , `` Goat , hast thou have enough ? '' the goat answer , `` I have eat so much , not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh ! '' `` come home , then , '' say the youth , and lead she into the stable , and tie she up . `` well , '' say the old tailor , `` have the goat have a proper amount of food ? '' `` she have eat so much , not a leaf more she 'll touch . '' the tailor do not trust to that , but go down and ask , `` Goat , hast thou have enough ? '' the wicked beast answer , `` wherewithal should I be satisfy ? among the grave I leap about , and find no leaf , so go without , meh ! meh ! '' `` oh , the brood of liar ! '' cry the tailor , `` each as wicked and forgetful of he duty as the other ! ye shall no longer make a fool of I , '' and quite beside himself with anger , he run upstairs and belabor the poor young fellow so vigorously with the yard-measure that he spring out of the house . the old tailor be now alone with he goat . next morning he go down into the stable , caress the goat and say , `` come , my dear little animal , I will take thee to feed myself . '' he take she by the rope and conduct she to green hedge , and amongst milfoil , and whatever else goat like to eat . `` there thou mayest for once eat to thy heart 's content , '' say he to she , and let she browse till evening . then he ask , `` Goat , art thou satisfy ? '' she reply , `` I have eat so much , not a leaf more I 'll touch , meh ! meh ! '' `` come home , then , '' say the tailor , and lead she into the stable , and tie she fast . when he be go away , he turn round again and say , `` well , art thou satisfy for once ? '' but the goat do not behave the better to he , and cry , `` wherewithal should I be satisfy ? among the grave I leap about , and find no leaf , so go without , meh ! meh ! '' when the tailor hear that , he be shock , and see clearly that he have drive away he three son without cause . `` wait , thou ungrateful creature , '' cry he , `` it be not enough to drive thee forth , I will mark thee so that thou wilt no more dare to show thyself amongst honest tailor . '' in great haste he run upstairs , fetch he razor , lather the goat 's head , and shave she as clean as the palm of he hand . and as the yard-measure would have be too good for she , he bring the horsewhip , and give she such cut with it that she run away in violent haste . when the tailor be thus leave quite alone in he house he fall into great grief , and would gladly have have he son back again , but no one know whither they be go . the eldest have apprentice himself to a joiner , and learn industriously and indefatigably , and when the time come for he to go travel , he master present he with a little table which have no particular appearance , and be make of common wood , but it have one good property ; if anyone set it out , and say , `` little table , spread thyself , '' the good little table be at once cover with a clean little cloth , and a plate be there , and a knife and fork beside it , and dish with boil meat and roasted meat , as many as there be room for , and a great glass of red wine shone so that it make the heart glad . the young journeyman thought , `` with this thou hast enough for thy whole life , '' and go joyously about the world and never trouble himself at all whether a inn be good or bad , or if anything be to be find in it or not . when it suit he he do not enter a inn at all , but either on the plain , in a wood , a meadow , or wherever he fancy , he take he little table off he back , set it down before he , and say , `` Cover thyself , '' and then everything appear that he heart desire . at length he take it into he head to go back to he father , whose anger would now be appease , and who would now willingly receive he with he wishing-table . it come to pass that on he way home , he come one evening to a inn which be fill with guest . they bid he welcome , and invite he to sit and eat with they , for otherwise he would have difficulty in get anything . `` no , '' answer the joiner , `` I will not take the few bite out of you mouth ; rather than that , you shall be my guest . '' they laugh , and think he be jest with they ; he , however , place he wooden table in the middle of the room , and say , `` little table , cover thyself . '' instantly it be cover with food , so good that the host could never have procure it , and the smell of it ascend pleasantly to the nostril of the guest . `` fall to , dear friend , '' say the joiner ; and the guest when they see that he mean it , do not need to be ask twice , but draw near , pull out they knife and attack it valiantly . and what surprise they the most be that when a dish become empty , a full one instantly take its place of its own accord . the innkeeper stand in one corner and watch the affair ; he do not at all know what to say , but think , `` Thou couldst easily find a use for such a cook as that in thy kitchen . '' the joiner and he comrade make merry until late into the night ; at length they lay down to sleep , and the young apprentice also go to bed , and set he magic table against the wall . the host 's thought , however , let he have no rest ; it occur to he that there be a little old table in he lumber-room which look just like the apprentice 's and he bring it out quite softly , and exchange it for the wishing-table . next morning , the joiner pay for he bed , take up he table , never think that he have get a false one , and go he way . at mid-day he reach he father , who receive he with great joy . `` well , my dear son , what hast thou learn ? '' say he to he . `` Father , I have become a joiner . '' `` a good trade , '' reply the old man ; `` but what hast thou bring back with thee from thy apprenticeship ? '' `` Father , the best thing which I have bring back with I be this little table . '' the tailor inspect it on all side and say , `` Thou didst not make a masterpiece when thou mad ` st that ; it be a bad old table . '' `` but it be a table which furnish itself , '' reply the son . `` when I set it out , and tell it to cover itself , the most beautiful dish stand on it , and a wine also , which gladden the heart . just invite all we relation and friend , they shall refresh and enjoy themselves for once , for the table will give they all they require . '' when the company be assemble , he put he table in the middle of the room and say , `` little table , cover thyself , '' but the little table do not bestir itself , and remain just as bare as any other table which do not understand language . then the poor apprentice become aware that he table have be change , and be ashamed at have to stand there like a liar . the relation , however , mock he , and be force to go home without have eat or drunk . the father bring out he patch again , and go on tailor , but the son go to a master in the craft . the second son have go to a miller and have apprentice himself to he . when he year be over , the master say , `` as thou hast conduct thyself so well , I give thee a ass of a peculiar kind , which neither draw a cart nor carry a sack . '' `` to what use be he put , then ? '' ask the young apprentice . `` he let gold drop from he mouth , '' answer the miller . `` if thou settest he on a cloth and sayest ` Bricklebrit , ' the good animal will drop gold piece for thee . '' `` that be a fine thing , '' say the apprentice , and thank the master , and go out into the world . when he have need of gold , he have only to say `` Bricklebrit '' to he ass , and it rain gold piece , and he have nothing to do but pick they off the ground . Wheresoever he go , the best of everything be good enough for he , and the dearer the better , for he have always a full purse . when he have look about the world for some time , he think , `` Thou must seek out thy father ; if thou goest to he with the gold-ass he will forget he anger , and receive thee well . '' it come to pass that he come to the same public-house in which he brother 's table have be exchange . he lead he ass by the bridle , and the host be about to take the animal from he and tie he up , but the young apprentice say , `` do not trouble yourself , I will take my gray horse into the stable , and tie he up myself too , for I must know where he stand . '' this strike the host as odd , and he think that a man who be force to look after he ass himself , could not have much to spend ; but when the stranger put he hand in he pocket and bring out two gold piece , and say he be to provide something good for he , the host open he eye wide , and run and seek out the best he could muster . after dinner the guest ask what he owe . the host do not see why he should not double the reckoning , and say the apprentice must give two more gold piece . he feel in he pocket , but he gold be just at a end . `` wait a instant , sir host , '' say he , `` I will go and fetch some money ; '' but he take the table-cloth with he . the host could not imagine what this could mean , and be curious , steal after he , and as the guest bolt the stable-door , he peep through a hole leave by a knot in the wood . the stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cry , `` Bricklebrit , '' and immediately the beast begin to let gold piece fall , so that it fairly rain down money on the ground . `` Eh , my word , '' say the host , `` ducat be quickly coin there ! a purse like that be not amiss . '' the guest pay he score , and go to bed , but in the night the host steal down into the stable , lead away the master of the mint , and tie up another ass in he place . early next morning the apprentice travel away with he ass , and think that he have he gold-ass . at mid-day he reach he father , who rejoice to see he again , and gladly take he in . `` what hast thou make of thyself , my son ? '' ask the old man . `` a miller , '' dear father , he answer . `` what hast thou bring back with thee from thy travels ? '' `` nothing else but a ass . '' `` there be ass enough here , '' say the father , `` I would rather have have a good goat . '' `` yes , '' reply the son , `` but it be no common ass , but a gold-ass , when I say ` Bricklebrit , ' the good beast open its mouth and drop a whole sheetful of gold piece . just summon all we relation hither , and I will make they rich folk . '' `` that suit I well , '' say the tailor , `` for then I shall have no need to torment myself any longer with the needle , '' and run out himself and call the relation together . as soon as they be assemble , the miller bid they make way , spread out he cloth , and bring the ass into the room . `` now watch , '' say he , and cry , `` Bricklebrit , '' but no gold piece fall , and it be clear that the animal know nothing of the art , for every ass do not attain such perfection . then the poor miller pull a long face , see that he be betray , and beg pardon of the relative , who go home as poor as they come . there be no help for it , the old man have to betake he to he needle once more , and the youth hire himself to a miller . the third brother have apprentice himself to a turner , and as that be skilled labor , he be the longest in learning . he brother , however , tell he in a letter how badly thing have go with they , and how the innkeeper have cheat they of they beautiful wishing-gifts on the last evening before they reach home . when the turner have serve he time , and have to set out on he travels , as he have conduct himself so well , he master present he with a sack and say , `` there be a cudgel in it . '' `` I can put on the sack , '' say he , `` and it may be of good service to I , but why should the cudgel be in it ? it only make it heavy . '' `` I will tell thee why , '' reply the master ; `` if any one have do anything to injure thee , do but say , ` out of the sack , Cudgel ! ' and the cudgel will leap forth among the people , and play such a dance on they back that they will not be able to stir or move for a week , and it will not leave off until thou sayest , ` Into the sack , Cudgel ! ' '' the apprentice thank he , and put the sack on he back , and when any one come too near he , and wish to attack he , he say , `` out of the sack , Cudgel ! '' and instantly the cudgel spring out , and dust the coat or jacket of one after the other on they back , and never stop until it have strip it off they , and it be do so quickly , that before anyone be aware , it be already he own turn . in the evening the young turner reach the inn where he brother have be cheat . he lay he sack on the table before he , and begin to talk of all the wonderful thing which he have see in the world . `` yes , '' say he , `` people may easily find a table which will cover itself , a gold-ass , and thing of that kind -- extremely good thing which I by no means despise -- but these be nothing in comparison with the treasure which I have win for myself , and be carry about with I in my sack there . '' the inn-keeper prick up he ear , `` what in the world can that be ? '' thought he ; `` the sack must be fill with nothing but jewel ; I ought to get they cheap too , for all good thing go in three . '' when it be time for sleep , the guest stretch himself on the bench , and lay he sack beneath he for a pillow . when the inn-keeper think he guest be lie in a sound sleep , he go to he and push and pull quite gently and carefully at the sack to see if he could possibly draw it away and lay another in its place . the turner have , however , be wait for this for a long time , and now just as the inn-keeper be about to give a hearty tug , he cry , `` out of the sack , Cudgel ! '' instantly the little cudgel come forth , and fall on the inn-keeper and give he a sound thrashing . the host cry for mercy ; but the louder he cry , so much more heavily the cudgel beat the time on he back , until at length he fall to the ground exhaust . then the turner say , `` if thou dost not give back the table which cover itself , and the gold-ass , the dance shall begin afresh . '' `` oh , no , '' cry the host , quite humbly , `` I will gladly produce everything , only make the accursed kobold creep back into the sack . '' then say the apprentice , `` I will let mercy take the place of justice , but beware of get into mischief again ! '' so he cry , `` Into the sack , Cudgel ! '' and let he have rest . next morning the turner go home to he father with the wishing-table , and the gold-ass . the tailor rejoice when he see he once more , and ask he likewise what he have learn in foreign part . `` dear father , '' say he , `` I have become a turner . '' `` a skilled trade , '' say the father . `` what hast thou bring back with thee from thy travels ? '' `` a precious thing , dear father , '' reply the son , `` a cudgel in the sack . '' `` what ! '' cry the father , `` a cudgel ! that be worth thy trouble , indeed ! from every tree thou can cut thyself one . '' `` but not one like this , dear father . if I say , ` out of the sack , Cudgel ! ' the cudgel spring out and lead any one who mean ill with I a weary dance , and never stop until he lie on the ground and pray for fair weather . look you , with this cudgel have I get back the wishing-table and the gold-ass which the thievish inn-keeper take away from my brother . now let they both be send for , and invite all we kinsman . I will give they to eat and to drink , and will fill they pocket with gold into the bargain . '' the old tailor would not quite believe , but nevertheless get the relative together . then the turner spread a cloth in the room and lead in the gold-ass , and say to he brother , `` now , dear brother , speak to he . '' the miller say , `` Bricklebrit , '' and instantly the gold piece fall down on the cloth like a thunder-shower , and the ass do not stop until every one of they have so much that he could carry no more . -lrb-B- I can see in thy face that thou also wouldst like to be there . -rrb-B- then the turner bring the little table , and say , `` now dear brother , speak to it . '' and scarcely have the carpenter say , `` Table , cover thyself , '' than it be spread and amply cover with the most exquisite dish . then such a meal take place as the good tailor have never yet know in he house , and the whole party of kinsman stay together till far in the night , and be all merry and glad . the tailor lock away needle and thread , yard-measure and goose , in a press , and live with he three son in joy and splendor . -lrb-B- what , however , have become of the goat who be to blame for the tailor drive out he three son ? that I will tell thee . she be ashamed that she have a bald head , and run to a fox 's hole and creep into it . when the fox come home , he be meet by two great eye shine out of the darkness , and be terrify and run away . a bear meet he , and as the fox look quite disturbed , he say , `` what be the matter with thee , brother Fox , why dost thou look like that ? '' `` ah , '' answer Redskin , `` a fierce beast be in my cave and stare at I with its fiery eye . '' `` we will soon drive he out , '' say the bear , and go with he to the cave and look in , but when he see the fiery eye , fear seize on he likewise ; he would have nothing to do with the furious beast , and take to he heel . the bee meet he , and as she see that he be ill at ease , she say , `` Bear , thou art really pull a very pitiful face ; what have become of all thy gaiety ? '' `` it be all very well for thee to talk , '' reply the bear , `` a furious beast with stare eye be in Redskin 's house , and we can not drive he out . '' the bee say , `` Bear I pity thee , I be a poor weak creature whom thou wouldst not turn aside to look at , but still , I believe , I can help thee . '' she fly into the fox 's cave , light on the goat 's smoothly-shorn head , and sting she so violently , that she spring up , cry `` Meh , meh , '' and run forth into the world as if mad , and to this hour no one know where she have go . -rrb-B-
