'' that remark make Fatty Coon angry . and he wish that Jimmy have not the pink-eye . he would have like to make a end of he right then and there . `` what do you mean ? '' he shout . `` Robber nothing ! I be just as good as you be ! '' `` of course , of course ! '' Jimmy say hastily . `` it be you face , you know , that black patch cover you eye just like a robber 's mask . that be why we want you to be the robber . '' Fatty have slip down he tree to the ground ; and now he look down into the creek . it be just as Jimmy say . Fatty have never think of it before , but the black patch of short fur across the upper part of he face make he look exactly like a robber . `` come on ! '' say Jimmy . `` we can not play the game without you . '' `` well -- all right ! '' say Fatty . he begin to feel proud of he mask . `` what shall I do ? '' `` you wait right here , '' Jimmy order . `` hide behind that tree . we 'll go into the wood . and when we come back past this spot you jump out and say ` hand up ! ' ... you understand ? '' `` of course ! '' say Fatty . `` but hurry up ! do not be go long . '' `` leave that to we , '' say Jimmy Rabbit . he wink at he brother ; and they start off together . Fatty Coon do not see that wink . if he have , he would not have wait there all the afternoon for those rabbit brother to return . they never come back at all . and they tell everybody about the trick they have play on Fatty Coon . for a long time after that wherever Fatty go the forest-people call `` Robber ! '' after he . and Jasper Jay be the most annoying of all , because whenever he shout `` Robber ! '' he always laugh so loudly and so long . he hoarse screech echo through the wood . and the worst of it be , everybody know what he be laugh at .
