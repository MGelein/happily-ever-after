120 the three ApprenticesS BrothersS Grimm there be once three apprentice , who have agree to keep always together while travel , and always to work in the same town . at one time , however , they master have no more work to give they , so that at last they be in rag , and have nothing to live on . then one of they say , `` what shall we do ? we can not stay here any longer , we will travel once more , and if we do not find any work in the town we go to , we will arrange with the innkeeper there , that we be to write and tell he where we be stay , so that we can always have news of each other , and then we will separate . '' and that seem best to the other also . they go forth , and meet on the way a richly-dressed man who ask who they be . `` we be apprentice look for work ; up to this time we have keep together , but if we can not find anything to do we be go to separate . '' `` there be no need for that , '' say the man , `` if you will do what I tell you , you shall not want for gold or for work ; nay , you shall become great lord , and drive in you carriage ! '' one of they say , `` if we soul and salvation be not endanger , we will certainly do it . '' `` they will not , '' reply the man , `` I have no claim on you . '' one of the other have , however , look at he foot , and when he see a horse 's foot and a man 's foot , he do not want to have anything to do with he . the Devil , however , say , `` be easy , I have no design on you , but on another soul , which be half my own already , and whose measure shall but run full . '' as they be now secure , they consent , and the Devil tell they what he want . the first be to answer , `` all three of we , '' to every question ; the second be to say , `` for money , '' and the third , `` and quite right too ! '' they be always to say this , one after the other , but they be not to say one word more , and if they disobey this order , all they money would disappear at once , but so long as they observe it , they pocket would always be full . as a beginning , he at once give they as much as they could carry , and tell they to go to such and such a inn when they get to the town . they go to it , and the innkeeper come to meet they , and ask if they wish for anything to eat ? the first reply , `` all three of we .

'' `` indeed it be right , '' say the host , `` all three pay , and without money I can give nothing . '' they , however , pay still more than he have ask . the lodger , who be look on , say , `` these people must be mad . '' `` yes , indeed they be , '' say the host , `` they be not very wise . '' so they stay some time in the inn , and say nothing else but , `` all three of we , '' `` for money , '' and `` and quite right too ! '' but they see and know all that be go on . it so happen that a great merchant come with a large sum of money , and say , `` Sir host , take care of my money for I , here be three crazy apprentice who might steal it from I .

'' the innkeeper , however , have they call , and say to they , `` have you kill the merchant ? '' `` all three of we , '' say the first , `` for money , '' say the second ; and the third add , `` and quite right too ! '' `` there now , you hear , '' say the host , `` they confess it themselves . '' they be take to prison , therefore , and be to be try . when they see that thing be go so seriously , they be after all afraid , but at night the Devil come and say , `` Bear it just one day longer , and do not play away you luck , not one hair of you head shall be hurt . '' the next morning they be lead to the bar , and the judge say , `` be you the murderer ? '' `` all three of we . '' `` why do you kill the merchant ? '' `` for money . '' `` you wicked wretch , you have no horror of you sin ? '' `` and quite right too ! '' `` they have confess , and be still stubborn , '' say the judge , `` lead they to death instantly .
