158 the Story of Schlauraffen Land BrothersS Grimm in the time of Schlauraffen I go there , and see Rome and the Lateran hanging by a small silken thread , and a man without foot who outrun a swift horse , and a keen sharp sword that cut through a bridge . there I see a young ass with a silver nose which pursue two fleet hare , and a lime-tree that be very large , on which hot cake be grow . there I see a lean old goat which carry about a hundred cart-loads of fat on he body , and sixty load of salt . Have I not tell enough lie ? there I see a plough ploughing without horse or cow , and a child of one year throw four millstone from Ratisbon to Treves , and from Treves to Strasburg , and a hawk swam over the Rhine , which he have a perfect right to do . there I hear some fish begin to make such a disturbance with each other , that it resound as far as heaven , and sweet honey flow like water from a deep valley at the top of a high mountain , and these be strange thing . there be two crow which be mow a meadow , and I see two gnat build a bridge , and two dove tear a wolf to piece ; two child bring forth two kid , and two frog threshed corn together . there I see two mouse consecrate a bishop , and two cat scratch out a bear 's tongue . then a snail come run up and kill two furious lion . there stand a barber and shave a woman 's beard off ; and two sucking-children bade they mother hold she tongue . there I see two greyhound which bring a mill out of the water ; and a sorry old horse be beside it , and say it be right . and four horse be stand in the yard thresh corn with all they might , and two goat be heat the stove , and a red cow shoot the bread into the oven . then a cock crow , Cock-a - doodle-doo ! the story be all tell , -- cock-a-doodle-doo !
