81 Brother Lustig BrothersS Grimm there be one on a time a great war , and when it come to a end , many soldier be discharge . then Brother Lustig also receive he dismissal , and besides that , nothing but a small loaf of contract-bread , and four kreuzer in money , with which he depart . St. Peter have , however , place himself in he way in the shape of a poor beggar , and when Brother Lustig come up , he beg alms of he . Brother Lustig reply , `` dear beggar-man , what be I to give you ? I have be a soldier , and have receive my dismissal , and have nothing but this little loaf of contract-bread , and four kreuzer of money ; when that be go , I shall have to beg as well as you . still I will give you something . '' Thereupon he divide the loaf into four part , and give the apostle one of they , and a kreuzer likewise . St. Peter thank he , go onward , and throw himself again in the soldier 's way as a beggar , but in another shape ; and when he come up beg a gift of he as before . Brother Lustig speak as he have do before , and again give he a quarter of the loaf and one kreuzer . St. Peter thank he , and go onward , but for the third time place himself in another shape as a beggar on the road , and speak to Brother Lustig . Brother Lustig give he also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer . St. Peter thank he , and Brother Lustig go onward , and have but a quarter of the loaf , and one kreuzer . with that he go into a inn , eat the bread , and order one kreuzer 's worth of beer . when he have have it , he journey onward , and then St. Peter , who have assume the appearance of a discharge soldier , meet and speak to he thus : `` good day , comrade , canst thou not give I a bit of bread , and a kreuzer to get a drink ? '' `` where be I to procure it ? '' answer Brother Lustig ; `` I have be discharge , and I get nothing but a loaf of ammunition-bread and four kreuzer in money . I meet three beggar on the road , and I give each of they a quarter of my bread , and one kreuzer . the last quarter I eat in the inn , and have a drink with the last kreuzer . now my pocket be empty , and if thou also hast nothing we can go a-begging together . '' `` no , '' answer St. Peter , `` we need not quite do that . I know a little about medicine , and I will soon earn as much as I require by that . '' `` indeed , '' say Brother Lustig , `` I know nothing of that , so I must go and beg alone . '' `` just come with I , '' say St. Peter , `` and if I earn anything , thou shalt have half of it . '' `` all right , '' say Brother Lustig , so they go away together . then they come to a peasant 's house inside which they hear loud lamentation and cry ; so they go in , and there the husband be lie sick unto death , and very near he end , and he wife be cry and weep quite loudly . `` stop that howl and cry , '' say St. Peter , `` I will make the man well again , '' and he take a salve out of he pocket , and heal the sick man in a moment , so that he could get up , and be in perfect health . in great delight the man and he wife say , `` how can we reward you ? what shall we give you ? '' but St. Peter would take nothing , and the more the peasant folk offer he , the more he refuse . Brother Lustig , however , nudge St. Peter , and say , `` take something ; sure enough we be in need of it . '' at length the woman bring a lamb and say to St. Peter that he really must take that , but he would not . then Brother Lustig give he a poke in the side , and say , `` do take it , you stupid fool ; we be in great want of it ! '' then St. Peter say at last , `` well , I will take the lamb , but I will not carry it ; if thou wilt insist on have it , thou must carry it . '' `` that be nothing , '' say Brother Lustig . `` I will easily carry it , '' and take it on he shoulder . then they depart and come to a wood , but Brother Lustig have begin to feel the lamb heavy , and he be hungry , so he say to St. Peter , `` look , that be a good place , we might cook the lamb there , and eat it . '' `` as you like , '' answer St. Peter , `` but I can not have anything to do with the cooking ; if thou wilt cook , there be a kettle for thee , and in the meantime I will walk about a little until it be ready . Thou must , however , not begin to eat until I have come back , I will come at the right time . '' `` well , go , then , '' say Brother Lustig , `` I understand cookery , I will manage it . '' then St. Peter go away , and Brother Lustig kill the lamb , light a fire , throw the meat into the kettle , and boil it . the lamb be , however , quite ready , and the apostle Peter have not come back , so Brother Lustig take it out of the kettle , cut it up , and find the heart . `` that be say to be the best part , '' say he , and taste it , but at last he eat it all up . at length St. Peter return and say , `` Thou mayst eat the whole of the lamb thyself , I will only have the heart , give I that . '' then Brother Lustig take a knife and fork , and pretend to look anxiously about amongst the lamb 's flesh , but not to be able to find the heart , and at last he say abruptly , `` there be none here . '' `` but where can it be ? '' say the apostle . `` I do not know , '' reply Brother Lustig , `` but look , what fool we both be , to seek for the lamb 's heart , and neither of we to remember that a lamb have no heart ! '' `` oh , '' say St. Peter , `` that be something quite new ! every animal have a heart , why be a lamb to have none ? '' `` no , be assure , my brother , '' say Brother Lustig , `` that a lamb have no heart ; just consider it seriously , and then you will see that it really have none . '' `` well , it be all right , '' say St. Peter , `` if there be no heart , then I want none of the lamb ; thou mayst eat it alone . '' `` what I can not eat now , I will carry away in my knapsack , '' say Brother Lustig , and he eat half the lamb , and put the rest in he knapsack . they go farther , and then St. Peter cause a great stream of water to flow right across they path , and they be oblige to pass through it . Said St. Peter , `` do thou go first . '' `` no , '' answer Brother Lustig , `` thou must go first , '' and he think , `` if the water be too deep I will stay behind . '' then St. Peter stride through it , and the water just reach to he knee . so Brother Lustig begin to go through also , but the water grow deeper and reach to he throat . then he cry , `` brother , help I ! '' St. Peter say , `` then wilt thou confess that thou hast eat the lamb 's heart ? '' `` no , '' say he , `` I have not eat it . '' then the water grow deeper still and rise to he mouth . `` help I , brother , '' cry the soldier . St. Peter say , `` then wilt thou confess that thou hast eat the lamb 's heart ? '' `` no , '' he reply , `` I have not eat it . '' St. Peter , however , would not let he be drown , but make the water sink and help he through it . then they journey onward , and come to a kingdom where they hear that the King 's daughter lay sick unto death . `` Hollo , brother ! '' say the soldier to St. Peter , `` this be a chance for we ; if we can heal she we shall be provide for , for life ! '' but St. Peter be not half quick enough for he , `` come , lift you leg , my dear brother , '' say he , `` that we may get there in time . '' but St. Peter walk slower and slower , though Brother Lustig do all he could to drive and push he on , and at last they hear that the princess be dead . `` now we be do for ! '' say Brother Lustig ; `` that come of thy sleepy way of walk ! '' `` just be quiet , '' answer St. Peter , `` I can do more than cure sick people ; I can bring dead one to life again . '' `` well , if thou canst do that , '' say Brother Lustig , `` it be all right , but thou shouldst earn at least half the kingdom for we by that . '' then they go to the royal palace , where every one be in great grief , but St. Peter tell the King that he would restore he daughter to life . he be take to she , and say , `` bring I a kettle and some water , '' and when that be bring , he bid everyone go out , and allow no one to remain with he but Brother Lustig . then he cut off all the dead girl 's limb , and throw they in the water , light a fire beneath the kettle , and boil they . and when the flesh have fall away from the bone , he take out the beautiful white bone , and lay they on a table , and arrange they together in they natural order . when he have do that , he step forward and say three time , `` in the name of the holy trinity , dead woman , arise . '' and at the third time , the princess arise , live , healthy and beautiful . then the King be in the greatest joy , and say to St. Peter , `` ask for thy reward ; even if it be half my kingdom , I would give it thee . '' but St. Peter say , `` I want nothing for it . '' `` oh , thou tomfool ! '' thought Brother Lustig to himself , and nudge he comrade 's side , and say , `` do not be so stupid ! if thou hast no need of anything , I have . '' St. Peter , however , would have nothing , but as the King see that the other would very much like to have something , he order he treasurer to fill Brother Lustig 's knapsack with gold . then they go on they way , and when they come to a forest , St. Peter say to Brother Lustig , `` now , we will divide the gold . '' `` yes , '' he reply , `` we will . '' so St. Peter divide the gold , and divide it into three heap . Brother Lustig think to himself , `` what craze have he get in he head now ? he be make three share , and there be only two of we ! '' but St. Peter say , `` I have divide it exactly ; there be one share for I , one for thee , and one for he who eat the lamb 's heart . '' `` oh , I eat that ! '' reply Brother Lustig , and hastily sweep up the gold . `` you may trust what I say . '' `` but how can that be true , '' say St. Peter , `` when a lamb have no heart ? '' `` Eh , what , brother , what can you be think of ? lamb have heart like other animal , why should only they have none ? '' `` well , so be it , '' say St. Peter , `` keep the gold to yourself , but I will stay with you no longer ; I will go my way alone . '' `` as you like , dear brother , '' answer Brother Lustig . `` Farewell . '' then St. Peter go a different road , but Brother Lustig think , `` it be a good thing that he have take himself off , he be certainly a strange saint , after all . '' then he have money enough , but do not know how to manage it , squander it , give it away , and and when some time have go by , once more have nothing . then he arrive in a certain country where he hear that a King 's daughter be dead . `` oh , ho ! '' thought he , `` that may be a good thing for I ; I will bring she to life again , and see that I be pay as I ought to be . '' so he go to the King , and offer to raise the dead girl to life again . now the King have hear that a discharge soldier be travel about and bring dead person to life again , and think that Brother Lustig be the man ; but as he have no confidence in he , he consult he councillor first , who say that he might give it a trial as he daughter be dead . then Brother Lustig order water to be bring to he in a kettle , bade every one go out , cut the limb off , throw they in the water and light a fire beneath , just as he have see St. Peter do . the water begin to boil , the flesh fall off , and then he take the bone out and lay they on the table , but he do not know the order in which to lay they , and place they all wrong and in confusion . then he stand before they and say , `` in the name of the most holy trinity , dead maiden , I bid thee arise , '' and he say this thrice , but the bone do not stir . so he say it thrice more , but also in vain : `` confounded girl that you be , get up ! '' cry he , `` get up , or it shall be worse for you ! '' when he have say that , St. Peter suddenly appear in he former shape as a discharge soldier ; he enter by the window and say , `` godless man , what art thou do ? how can the dead maiden arise , when thou hast throw about she bone in such confusion ? '' `` dear brother , I have do everything to the best of my ability , '' he answer . `` this once , I will help thee out of thy difficulty , but one thing I tell thee , and that be that if ever thou undertakest anything of the kind again , it will be the worse for thee , and also that thou must neither demand nor accept the smallest thing from the King for this ! '' Thereupon St. Peter lay the bone in they right order , say to the maiden three time , `` in the name of the most holy trinity , dead maiden , arise , '' and the King 's daughter arise , healthy and beautiful as before . then St. Peter go away again by the window , and Brother Lustig be rejoice to find that all have pass off so well , but be very much vex to think that after all he be not to take anything for it . `` I should just like to know , '' think he , `` what fancy that fellow have get in he head , for what he give with one hand he take away with the other there be no sense whatever in it ! '' then the King offer Brother Lustig whatsoever he wish to have , but he do not dare to take anything ; however , by hint and cunning , he contrived to make the King order he knapsack to be fill with gold for he , and with that he depart . when he get out , St. Peter be stand by the door , and say , `` just look what a man thou art ; do I not forbid thee to take anything , and there thou hast thy knapsack full of gold ! '' `` how can I help that , '' answer Brother Lustig , `` if people will put it in for I ? '' `` well , I tell thee this , that if ever thou settest about anything of this kind again thou shalt suffer for it ! '' `` eh , brother , have no fear , now I have money , why should I trouble myself with wash bone ? '' `` faith , '' say St. Peter , `` the gold will last a long time ! in order that after this thou mayst never tread in forbid path , I will bestow on thy knapsack this property , namely , that whatsoever thou wishest to have inside it , shall be there . Farewell , thou wilt now never see I more . '' `` good-bye , '' say Brother Lustig , and think to himself , `` I be very glad that thou hast take thyself off , thou strange fellow ; I shall certainly not follow thee . '' but of the magical power which have be bestow on he knapsack , he think no more . Brother Lustig travel about with he money , and squander and waste what he have as before . when at last he have no more than four kreuzer , he pass by a inn and thought , `` the money must go , '' and order three kreuzer ' worth of wine and one kreuzer 's worth of bread for himself . as he be sit there drinking , the smell of roast goose make its way to he nose . Brother Lustig look about and peep , and see that the host have two geese standing in the oven . then he remember that he comrade have say that whatsoever he wish to have in he knapsack should be there , so he say , `` oh , ho ! I must try that with the goose . '' so he go out , and when he be outside the door , he say , `` I wish those two roasted goose out of the oven and in my knapsack , '' and when he have say that , he unbuckle it and look in , and there they be inside it . `` ah , that be right ! '' say he , `` now I be a make man ! '' and go away to a meadow and take out the roast meat . when he be in the midst of he meal , two journeyman come up and look at the second goose , which be not yet touch , with hungry eye . Brother Lustig think to himself , `` one be enough for I , '' and call the two man up and say , `` take the goose , and eat it to my health . '' they thank he , and go with it to the inn , order themselves a half bottle of wine and a loaf , take out the goose which have be give they , and begin to eat . the hostess see they and say to she husband , `` those two be eat a goose ; just look and see if it be not one of ours , out of the oven . '' the landlord run thither , and behold the oven be empty ! `` what ! '' cry he , `` you thievish crew , you want to eat goose as cheap as that ? pay for it this moment ; or I will wash you well with green hazel-sap . '' the two say , `` we be no thief , a discharge soldier give we the goose , outside there in the meadow . '' `` you shall not throw dust in my eye that way ! the soldier be here but he go out by the door , like a honest fellow . I look after he myself ; you be the thief and shall pay ! '' but as they could not pay , he take a stick , and cudgel they out of the house . Brother Lustig go he way and come to a place where there be a magnificent castle , and not far from it a wretched inn . he go to the inn and ask for a night 's lodging , but the landlord turn he away , and say , `` there be no more room here , the house be full of noble guest . '' `` it surprise I that they should come to you and not go to that splendid castle , '' say Brother Lustig . `` ah , indeed , '' reply the host , `` but it be no slight matter to sleep there for a night ; no one who have try it so far , have ever come out of it alive . '' `` if other have try it , '' say Brother Lustig , `` I will try it too . '' `` leave it alone , '' say the host , `` it will cost you you neck . '' `` it will not kill I at once , '' say Brother Lustig , `` just give I the key , and some good food and wine . '' so the host give he the key , and food and wine , and with this Brother Lustig go into the castle , enjoy he supper , and at length , as he be sleepy , he lay down on the ground , for there be no bed . he soon fall asleep , but during the night be disturb by a great noise , and when he awake , he see nine ugly devil in the room , who have make a circle , and be dance around he . Brother Lustig say , `` well , dance as long as you like , but none of you must come too close . '' but the devil press continually nearer to he , and almost step on he face with they hideous foot . `` stop , you devil ' ghost , '' say he , but they behave still worse . then Brother Lustig grow angry , and cry , `` Hola ! but I will soon make it quiet , '' and get the leg of a chair and strike out into the midst of they with it . but nine devil against one soldier be still too many , and when he strike those in front of he , the other seize he behind by the hair , and tear it unmercifully . `` devil ' crew , '' cry he , `` it be get too bad , but wait . Into my knapsack , all nine of you ! '' in a instant they be in it , and then he buckle it up and throw it into a corner . after this all be suddenly quiet , and Brother Lustig lay down again , and sleep till it be bright day . then come the inn-keeper , and the nobleman to whom the castle belong , to see how he have fare ; but when they perceive that he be merry and well they be astonish , and ask , `` have the spirit do you no harm , then ? '' `` the reason why they have not , '' answer Brother Lustig , `` be because I have get the whole nine of they in my knapsack ! you may once more inhabit you castle quite tranquilly , none of they will ever haunt it again . '' the nobleman thank he , make he rich present , and beg he to remain in he service , and he would provide for he as long as he live . `` no , '' reply Brother Lustig , `` I be use to wander about , I will travel farther . '' then he go away , and enter into a smithy , lay the knapsack , which contain the nine devil on the anvil , and ask the smith and he apprentice to strike it . so they smite with they great hammer with all they strength , and the devil utter howl which be quite pitiable . when he open the knapsack after this , eight of they be dead , but one which have be lie in a fold of it , be still alive , slip out , and go back again to hell . Thereupon Brother Lustig travel a long time about the world , and those who know they can tell many a story about he , but at last he grow old , and thought of he end , so he go to a hermit who be know to be a pious man , and say to he , `` I be tire of wander about , and want now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven . '' the hermit reply , `` there be two road , one be broad and pleasant , and lead to hell , the other be narrow and rough , and lead to heaven . '' `` I should be a fool , '' think Brother Lustig , `` if I be to take the narrow , rough road . '' so he set out and take the broad and pleasant road , and at length come to a great black door , which be the door of Hell . Brother Lustig knock , and the door-keeper peep out to see who be there . but when he see Brother Lustig , he be terrify , for he be the very same ninth devil who have be shut up in the knapsack , and have escape from it with a black eye . so he push the bolt in again as quickly as he could , run to the devil 's lieutenant , and say , `` there be a fellow outside with a knapsack , who want to come in , but as you value you life do not allow he to enter , or he will wish the whole of hell into he knapsack . he once give I a frightful hammering when I be inside it . '' so they call out to Brother Lustig that he be to go away again , for he should not get in there ! `` if they will not have I here , '' think he , `` I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven , for I must be somewhere . '' so he turn about and go onwards until he come to the door of Heaven , where he knock . St. Peter be sit hard by as door-keeper . Brother Lustig recognize he at once , and think , `` here I find a old friend , I shall get on better . '' but St. Peter say , `` I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven . '' `` let I in , brother ; I must get in somewhere ; if they would have take I into Hell , I should not have come here . '' `` no , '' say St. Peter , `` thou shalt not enter . '' `` then if thou wilt not let I in , take thy knapsack back , for I will have nothing at all from thee . '' `` give it here , then , '' say St. Peter . then Brother Lustig give he the knapsack into Heaven through the bar , and St. Peter take it , and hang it beside he seat . then say Brother Lustig , `` and now I wish myself inside my knapsack , '' and in a second he be in it , and in Heaven , and St. Peter be force to let he stay there .
