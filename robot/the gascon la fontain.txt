the GASCON La Fontain I be always incline to suspect the best story under the sun as soon as by chance I detect that teller and hero be one . we be all of we prone to conceit , and like to proclaim we own glory , but we purpose we be apt to defeat as actor in chief of we story . to prove the truth of what I state let I a anecdote relate : a Gascon with he comrade sit at tavern drinking . this and that he vaunted with assertion pat . from gasconade to gasconade pass to the conquest he have make in love . a buxom country maid , who serve the wine , with due attention lend patient ear to each invention , and press she hand against she side she burst merriment to hide . to hear we Gascon talk , no Sue nor Poll in town but that he know ; with each he would pass a blissful night more to they own than he delight . this one he love for she be fair , that for she glossy ebon hair . one miss , to tame he cruel rigor , have bring he gift . -- she own he vigor in short it want but he gaze to set each tremble heart ablaze . he strength surpass he luck , -- the test -- in one short night ten time he would bless a dame who gratefully express she thanks with corresponding zest . at this the maid burst forth , `` what more ? `` I never hear such lie before ! `` content be I if at that sport `` I have what that poor dame be short .
