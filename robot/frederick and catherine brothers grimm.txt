'' `` just go , Frederick , '' answer Kate , `` just go , I will have all ready for you . '' therefore when dinner-time draw near she get a sausage out of the chimney , put it in the frying-pan , put some butter to it , and set it on the fire . the sausage begin to fry and to hiss , Catherine stand beside it and hold the handle of the pan , and have she own thought as she be do it . then it occur to she , `` while the sausage be get do thou couldst go into the cellar and draw beer . '' so she set the frying-pan safely on the fire , take a can , and go down into the cellar to draw beer . the beer run into the can and Kate watch it , and then she think , `` oh , dear ! the dog upstairs be not fasten up , it might get the sausage out of the pan . well thought of . '' and in a trice she be up the cellar-steps again , but the Spitz have the sausage in its mouth already , and trail it away on the ground . but Catherine , who be not idle , set out after it , and chase it a long way into the field ; the dog , however , be swifter than Catherine and do not let the sausage journey easily , but skip over the furrow with it . `` what be go be go ! '' say Kate , and turn round , and as she have run till she be weary , she walk quietly and comfortably , and cool herself . during this time the beer be still run out of the cask , for Kate have not turn the tap . and when the can be full and there be no other place for it , it run into the cellar and do not stop until the whole cask be empty . as soon as Kate be on the step she see the mischance . `` good gracious ! '' she cry . `` what shall I do now to stop Frederick know it ! '' she think for a while , and at last she remember that up in the garret be still stand a sack of the finest wheat flour from the last fair , and she would fetch that down and strew it over the beer . `` yes , '' say she , `` he who save a thing when he ought , have it afterwards when he need it , '' and she climb up to the garret and carry the sack below , and throw it straight down on the can of beer , which she knock over , and Frederick 's draught swam also in the cellar . `` it be all right , '' say Kate , `` where the one be the other ought to be also , '' and she strew the meal over the whole cellar . when it be do she be heartily delighted with she work , and say , `` how clean and wholesome it do look here ! '' at mid-day home come Frederick : `` now , wife , what have you ready for I ? '' `` ah , Freddy , '' she answer , `` I be fry a sausage for you , but whilst I be draw the beer to drink with it , the dog take it away out of the pan , and whilst I be run after the dog , all the beer run out , and whilst I be dry up the beer with the flour , I knock over the can as well , but be easy , the cellar be quite dry again . '' Said Frederick , `` Kate , Kate , you should not have do that ! to let the sausage be carry off and the beer run out of the cask , and throw out all we flour into the bargain ! '' `` indeed , Frederick , I do not know that , you should have tell I . '' the man think , `` if my wife be like this , I must look after thing more . '' now he have get together a good number of thaler which he change into gold , and say to Catherine , `` look , these be counter for play game ; I will put they in a pot and bury they in the stable under the cow 's manger , but mind you keep away from they , or it will be the worse for you . '' Said she , `` oh , no , Frederick , I certainly will not go . '' and when Frederick be go some pedlar come into the village who have cheap earthen-bowls and pot , and ask the young woman if there be nothing she want to bargain with they for ? `` oh , dear people , '' say Catherine , `` I have no money and can buy nothing , but if you have any use for yellow counter I will buy of you . '' `` yellow counter , why not ? but just let we see they . '' `` then go into the stable and dig under the cow 's manger , and you will find the yellow counter . I be not allow to go there . '' the rogue go thither , dig and find pure gold . then they lay hold of it , run away , and leave they pot and bowl behind in the house . Catherine though she must use she new thing , and as she have no lack in the kitchen already without these , she knock the bottom out of every pot , and set they all as ornament on the paling which go round about the house . when Frederick come and see the new decoration , he say , `` Catherine , what have you be about ? '' `` I have buy they , Frederick , for the counter which be under the cow 's manger . I do not go there myself , the pedlar have to dig they out for themselves . '' `` ah , wife , '' say Frederick , `` what have you do ? those be not counter , but pure gold , and all we wealth ; you should not have do that . '' `` indeed , Frederick , '' say she , `` I do not know that , you should have forewarn I . '' Catherine stand for a while and bethought to herself ; then she say , `` listen , Frederick , we will soon get the gold back again , we will run after the thief . '' `` come , then , '' say Frederick , `` we will try it ; but take with you some butter and cheese that we may have something to eat on the way . '' `` yes , Frederick , I will take they . '' they set out , and as Frederick be the better walker , Catherine follow he . `` it be to my advantage , '' think she , `` when we turn back I shall be a little way in advance . '' then she come to a hill where there be deep rut on both side of the road . `` there one can see , '' say Catherine , `` how they have tear and skin and gall the poor earth , it will never be whole again as long as it live , '' and in she heart 's compassion she take she butter and smear the rut right and left , that they might not be so hurt by the wheel , and as she be thus bend down in she charity , one of the cheese roll out of she pocket down the hill . Said Catherine , `` I have make my way once up here , I will not go down again ; another may run and fetch it back . '' so she take another cheese and roll it down . but the cheese do not come back , so she let a third run down , think . `` perhaps they be wait for company , and do not like to walk alone . '' as all three stay away she say , `` I do not know what that can mean , but it may perhaps be that the third have not find the way , and have go wrong , I will just send the fourth to call it . '' but the fourth do no better than the third . then Catherine be angry , and throw down the fifth and sixth as well , and these be she last . she remain stand for some time watch for they come , but when they still do not come , she say , `` oh , you be good folk to send in search of death , you stay a fine long time away ! Do you think I will wait any longer for you ? I shall go my way , you may run after I ; you have younger leg than i. '' Catherine go on and find Frederick , who be stand wait for she because he want something to eat . `` now just let we have what you have bring with you , '' say he . she give he the dry bread . `` where have you the butter and the cheese ? '' ask the man . `` ah , Freddy , '' say Catherine , `` I smear the cart-ruts with the butter and the cheese will come soon ; one run away from I , so I send the other after to call it . '' Said Frederick , `` you should not have do that , Catherine , to smear the butter on the road , and let the cheese run down the hill ! '' `` really , Frederick , you should have tell I . '' then they eat the dry bread together , and Frederick say , `` Catherine , do you make the house safe when you come away ? '' `` no , Frederick , you should have tell I to do it before . '' `` then go home again , and make the house safe before we go any farther , and bring with you something else to eat . I will wait here for you . '' Catherine go back and think , `` Frederick want something more to eat , he do not like butter and cheese , so I will take with I a handkerchief full of dry pear and a pitcher of vinegar for he to drink . '' then she bolt the upper half of the door fast , but unhinge the lower door , and take it on she back , believe that when she have place the door in security the house must be well take care of . Catherine take she time on the way , and think , `` Frederick will rest himself so much the longer . '' when she have once reach he she say , `` here be the house-door for you , Frederick , and now you can take care of the house yourself . '' `` oh , heaven , '' say he , `` what a wise wife I have ! she take the under-door off the hinge that everything may run in , and bolt the upper one . it be now too late to go back home again , but since you have bring the door here , you shall just carry it farther . '' `` I will carry the door , Frederick , but the dry pear and the vinegar-jug will be too heavy for I , I will hang they on the door , it may carry they . '' and now they go into the forest , and seek the rogue , but do not find they . at length as it grow dark they climb into a tree and resolve to spend the night there . scarcely , however , have they sit down at the top of it than the rascal come thither who carry away with they what do not want to go , and find thing before they be lose . they sit down under the very tree in which Frederick and Catherine be sit , light a fire , and be about to share they booty . Frederick get down on the other side and collect some stone together . then he climb up again with they , and wish to throw they at the thief and kill they . the stone , however , do not hit they , and the knave cry , `` it will soon be morning , the wind be shake down the fir-apples . '' Catherine still have the door on she back , and as it press so heavily on she , she think it be the fault of the dry pear , and say , `` Frederick , I must throw the pear down . '' `` no , Catherine , not now , '' he reply , `` they might betray we . '' `` oh , but , Frederick , I must ! they weigh I down far too much . '' `` do it , then , and be hang ! '' then the dry pear roll down between the branch , and the rascal below say , `` the leaf be fall . '' a short time afterwards , as the door be still heavy , Catherine say , `` ah , Frederick , I must pour out the vinegar . '' `` no , Catherine , you must not , it might betray we . '' `` ah , but , Frederick , I must , it weigh I down far too much . '' `` then do it and be hang ! '' so she empty out the vinegar , and it besprinkle the robber . they say amongst themselves , `` the dew be already fall . '' at length Catherine think , `` can it really be the door which weigh I down so ? '' and say , `` Frederick , I must throw the door down . '' `` no , not now , Catherine , it might discover we . '' `` oh , but , Frederick , I must . it weigh I down far too much . '' `` oh , no , Catherine , do hold it fast . '' `` ah , Frederick , I be let it fall ! '' `` let it go , then , in the devil 's name . '' then it fall down with a violent clatter , and the rascal below cried , `` the devil be come down the tree ! '' and they run away and leave everything behind they . early next morning , when the two come down they find all they gold again , and carry it home . when they be once more at home , Frederick say , `` and now , Catherine , you , too , must be industrious and work . '' `` yes , Frederick , I will soon do that , I will go into the field and cut corn . '' when Catherine get into the field , she say to herself , `` Shall I eat before I cut , or shall I sleep before I cut ? oh , I will eat first . '' then Catherine eat and eat make she sleepy , and she begin to cut , and half in a dream cut all she clothes to piece , she apron , she gown , and she shift . when Catherine awake again after a long sleep she be stand there half-naked , and say to herself , `` be it I , or be it not I ? Alas , it be not i. '' in the meantime night come , and Catherine run into the village , knock at she husband 's window , and cry , `` Frederick . '' `` what be the matter ? '' `` I should very much like to know if Catherine be in ? '' `` yes , yes , '' reply Frederick , `` she must be in and asleep . '' Said she , '' ` Tis well , then I be certainly at home already , '' and run away . outside Catherine find some vagabond who be go to steal . then she go to they and say , `` I will help you to steal . '' the rascal think that she know the situation of the place , and be willing . Catherine go in front of the house , and cry , `` good folk , have you anything ? we want to steal . '' the thief think to themselves , `` that be a fine way of do thing , '' and wish themselves once more rid of Catherine . then they say to she , `` outside the village the pastor have some turnip in the field . go there and pull up some turnip for we . '' Catherine go to the ground , and begin to pull they up , but be so idle that she do not gather they together . then a man come by , see she , and stand still and think that it be the devil who be thus root amongst the turnip . he run away into the village to the pastor , and say , `` Mr. Pastor , the devil be in you turnip-ground , root up turnip . '' `` ah , heaven , '' answer the pastor , `` I have a lame foot , I can not go out and drive he away . '' Said the man , `` then I will carry you on my back , '' and he carry he out on he back . and when they come to the ground , Catherine arise and stand up she full height . `` ah , the devil ! '' cry the pastor , and both hurry away , and in he great fright the pastor could run better with he lame foot than the man who have carry he on he back could do with he sound one .
