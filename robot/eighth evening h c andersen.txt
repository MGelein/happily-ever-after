EIGHTH evening . H. C. Andersen Heavy cloud obscure the sky , and the Moon do not make he appearance at all . I stand in my little room , more lonely than ever , and look up at the sky where he ought to have show himself . my thought fly far away , up to my great friend , who every evening tell I such pretty tale , and show I picture . yes , he have have a experience indeed . he glide over the water of the Deluge , and smile on Noah 's ark just as he lately glance down upon I , and bring comfort and promise of a new world that be to spring forth from the old . when the Children of Israel sit weep by the water of Babylon , he glance mournfully upon the willow where hang the silent harp . when Romeo climb the balcony , and the promise of true love flutter like a cherub toward heaven , the round moon hang , half hidden among the dark cypress , in the lucid air . he see the captive giant at St. Helena , look from the lonely rock across the wide ocean , while great thought sweep through he soul . ah ! what tale the moon can tell . human life be like a story to he . to-night I shall not see thee again , old friend . to-night I can draw no picture of the memory of thy visit . and , as I look dreamily towards the cloud , the sky become bright . there be a glancing light , and a beam from the moon fall upon I . it vanish again , and dark cloud fly past ; but still it be a greet , a friendly good-night offer to I by the moon .
