'' and she go home to she father and say , `` Father , I wish to marry the prince who have come to you kingdom ; for I know he be the Prince Majnun I be to marry . '' `` very well , you shall have he for you husband , '' say Munsuk Raja . `` we will ask he to-morrow . '' Laili consent to wait , although she be very impatient . as it happen , the prince leave the Phalana kingdom that night , and when Laili hear he be go , she go quite mad . she would not listen to a word she father , or she mother , or she servant say to she , but go off into the jungle , and wander from jungle to jungle , till she get farther and farther away from she own country . all the time she keep say , `` Majnun , Majnun ; I want Majnun ; '' and so she wander about for twelve year . at the end of the twelve year she meet a fakir -- he be really a angel , but she do not know this -- who ask she , `` why do you always say , ` Majnun , Majnun ; I want Majnun ' ? '' she answer , `` I be the daughter of the king of the Phalana country , and I want to find Prince Majnun ; tell I where he kingdom be . '' `` I think you will never get there , '' say the fakir , `` for it be very far from hence , and you have to cross many river to reach it . '' but Laili say she do not care ; she must see Prince Majnun . `` well , '' say the fakir , `` when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish , a Rohu ; and you must get he to carry you to Prince Majnun 's country , or you will never reach it . '' she go on and on , and at last she come to the Bhagirathi river . there be a great big fish call the Rohu fish . it be yawn just as she get up to it , and she instantly jump down its throat into its stomach . all the time she keep say , `` Majnun , Majnun . '' at this the Rohu fish be greatly alarmed and swim down the river as fast as he could . by degree he get tired and go slower , and a crow come and perch on he back , and say `` Caw , caw . '' `` oh , Mr. Crow , '' say the poor fish `` do see what be in my stomach that make such a noise . '' `` very well , '' say the crow , `` open you mouth wide , and I 'll fly down and see . '' so the Rohu open he jaw and the crow fly down , but he come up again very quickly . `` you have a Rakshas in you stomach , '' say the crow , and he fly away . this news do not comfort the poor Rohu , and he swim on and on till he come to Prince Majnun 's country . there he stop . and a jackal come down to the river to drink . `` oh , jackal , '' say the Rohu `` do tell I what I have inside I . '' `` how can I tell ? '' say the jackal . `` I can not see unless I go inside you . '' so the Rohu open he mouth wide , and the jackal jump down he throat ; but he come up very quickly , look much frightened and say , `` you have a Rakshas in you stomach , and if I do not run away quickly , I be afraid it will eat I . '' so off he run . after the jackal come a enormous snake . `` oh , '' say the fish , `` do tell I what I have in my stomach , for it rattle about so , and keep say , ` Majnun , Majnun ; I want Majnun . ' '' the snake say , `` open you mouth wide , and I 'll go down and see what it be . '' the snake go down : when he return he say , `` you have a Rakshas in you stomach , but if you will let I cut you open , it will come out of you . '' `` if you do that , I shall die , '' say the Rohu . `` oh , no , '' say the snake , `` you will not , for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again . '' so the fish agree , and the snake get a knife and cut he open , and out jump Laili . she be now very old . twelve year she have wander about the jungle , and for twelve year she have live inside she Rohu ; and she be no longer beautiful , and have lose she tooth . the snake take she on he back and carry she into the country , and there he put she down , and she wander on and on till she get to Majnun 's court-house , where King Majnun be sit . there some man hear she cry , `` Majnun , Majnun ; I want Majnun , '' and they ask she what she want . `` I want King Majnun , '' she say . so they go in and say to Prince Majnun , `` a old woman outside say she want you . '' `` I can not leave this place , '' say he ; `` send she in here . '' they bring she in and the prince ask she what she want . `` I want to marry you , '' she answer . `` twenty-four year ago you come to my father the Phalana Raja 's country , and I want to marry you then ; but you go away without marry I . then I go mad , and I have wander about all these year look for you . '' Prince Majnun say , `` very good . '' `` pray to Khuda , '' say Laili , `` to make we both young again , and then we shall be marry . '' so the prince pray to Khuda , and Khuda say to he , `` Touch Laili 's clothes and they will catch fire , and when they be on fire , she and you will become young again . '' when he touch Laili 's clothes they catch fire , and she and he become young again . and there be great feast , and they be marry , and travel to the Phalana country to see she father and mother . now Laili 's father and mother have weep so much for they daughter that they have become quite blind , and she father keep always repeat , `` Laili , Laili , Laili . '' when Laili see they blindness , she pray to Khuda to restore they sight to they , which he do . as soon as the father and mother see Laili , they hug she and kiss she , and then they have the wedding all over again amid great rejoicing . Prince Majnum and Laili stay with Munsuk Raja and he wife for three year , and then they return to King Dantal , and live happily for some time with he . they use to go out hunting , and they often go from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves . one day Prince Majnun say to Laili , `` let we go through this jungle . '' `` no , no , '' say Laili ; `` if we go through this jungle , some harm will happen to I . '' but Prince Majnun laugh , and go into the jungle . and as they be go through it , Khuda think , `` I should like to know how much Prince Majnun love he wife . would he be very sorry if she die ? and would he marry another wife ? I will see . '' so he send one of he angel in the form of a fakir into the jungle ; and the angel go up to Laili , and throw some powder in she face , and instantly she fall to the ground a heap of ash . Prince Majnun be in great sorrow and grief when he see he dear Laili turn into a little heap of ash ; and he go straight home to he father , and for a long , long time he would not be comfort . after a great many year he grow more cheerful and happy , and begin to go again into he father 's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat . King Dantal wish he son to marry again . `` I will only have Laili for my wife ; I will not marry any other woman , '' say Prince Majnun . `` how can you marry Laili ? Laili be dead . she will never come back to you , '' say the father . `` then I 'll not have any wife at all , '' say Prince Majnun . meanwhile Laili be live in the jungle where she husband have leave she a little heap of ash . as soon as Majnun have go , the fakir have take she ash and make they quite clean , and then he have mixed clay and water with the ash , and make the figure of a woman with they , and so Laili regain she human form , and Khuda send life into it . but Laili have become once more a hideous old woman , with a long , long nose , and tooth like tusk ; just such a old woman , except she tooth , as she have be when she come out of the Rohu fish ; and she live in the jungle , and neither eat nor drank , and she keep on say , `` Majnun , Majnun ; I want Majnun . '' at last the angel who have come as a fakir and throw the powder at she , say to Khuda , `` of what use be it that this woman should sit in the jungle cry , cry for ever , ` Majnun , Majnun ; I want Majnun , ' and eat and drink nothing ? let I take she to Prince Majnun . '' `` well , '' say Khuda , `` you may do so ; but tell she that she must not speak to Majnun if he be afraid of she when he see she ; and that if he be afraid when he see she , she will become a little white dog the next day . then she must go to the palace , and she will only regain she human shape when Prince Majnun love she , feed she with he own food , and let she sleep in he bed . '' so the angel come to laili again as a fakir and carry she to King Dantal 's garden . `` now , '' he say , `` it be Khuda 's command that you stay here till Prince Majnun come to walk in the garden , and then you may show yourself to he . but you must not speak to he , if he be afraid of you ; and should he be afraid of you , you will the next day become a little white dog . '' he then tell she what she must do as a little dog to regain she human form . Laili stay in the garden , hide in the tall grass , till Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat come to walk in the garden . King Dantal be now a very old man , and Husain Mahamat , though he be really only as old as Prince Majnun , look a great deal older than the prince , who have be make quite young again when he marry Laili . as Prince Majnun and the Wazir 's son walk in the garden , they gather the fruit as they have do as little child , only they bit the fruit with they tooth ; they do not cut it . while Majnun be busy eat a fruit in this way , and be talk to Husain Mahamat , he turn towards he and see Laili walk behind the Wazir 's son . `` oh , look , look ! '' he cry , `` see what be follow you ; it be a Rakshas or a demon , and I be sure it be go to eat we . '' Laili look at he beseechingly with all she eye , and tremble with age and eagerness ; but this only frightened Majnun the more . `` it be a Rakshas , a Rakshas ! '' he cry , and he run quickly to the palace with the Wazir 's son ; and as they run away , Laili disappear into the jungle . they run to King Dantal , and Majnun tell he there be a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that have come to eat they . `` what nonsense , '' say he father . `` Fancy two grown man be so frighten by a old ayah or a fakir ! and if it have be a Rakshas , it would not have eat you . '' indeed King Dantal do not believe Majnun have see anything at all , till Husain Mahamat say the prince be speak the exact truth . they have the garden search for the terrible old woman , but find nothing , and King Dantal tell he son he be very silly to be so much frightened . however , Prince Majnun would not walk in the garden any more . the next day Laili turn into a pretty little dog ; and in this shape she come into the palace , where Prince Majnun soon become very fond of she . she follow he everywhere , go with he when he be out hunting , and help he to catch he game , and Prince Majnun feed she with milk , or bread , or anything else he be eat , and at night the little dog sleep in he bed . but one night the little dog disappear , and in its stead there lay the little old woman who have frighten he so much in the garden ; and now Prince Majnun be quite sure she be a Rakshas , or a demon , or some such horrible thing come to eat he ; and in he terror he cry out , `` what do you want ? oh , do not eat I ; do not eat I ! '' Poor Laili answer , `` do not you know I ? I be you wife Laili , and I want to marry you . do not you remember how you would go through that jungle , though I beg and beg you not to go , for I tell you that harm would happen to I , and then a fakir come and throw powder in my face , and I become a heap of ash . but Khuda give I my life again , and bring I here , after I have stay a long , long while in the jungle cry for you , and now I be oblige to be a little dog ; but if you will marry I , I shall not be a little dog any more . '' Majnun , however , say `` how can I marry a old woman like you ? how can you be Laili ? I be sure you be a Rakshas or a demon come to eat I , '' and he be in great terror . in the morning the old woman have turn into the little dog , and the prince go to he father and tell he all that have happen . `` a old woman ! a old woman ! always a old woman ! '' say he father . `` you do nothing but think of old woman . how can a strong man like you be so easily frighten ? '' however , when he see that he son be really in great terror , and that he really believe the old woman would come back at night , he advise he to say to she , `` I will marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again . how can I marry such a old woman as you be ? '' that night as he lay tremble in bed the little old woman lay there in place of the dog , cry `` Majnun , Majnun , I want to marry you . I have love you all these long , long year . when I be in my father 's kingdom a young girl , I know of you , though you know nothing of I , and we should have be marry then if you have not go away so suddenly , and for long , long year I follow you . '' `` well , '' say Majnun , `` if you can make yourself a young girl again , I will marry you . '' Laili say , `` oh , that be quite easy . Khuda will make I a young girl again . in two day ' time you must go into the garden , and there you will see a beautiful fruit . you must gather it and bring it into you room and cut it open yourself very gently , and you must not open it when you father or anybody else be with you , but when you be quite alone ; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked , without any clothes at all on . '' in the morning Laili take she little dog 's form , and disappear in the garden . Prince Majnun tell all this to he father , who tell he to do all the old woman have bid he . in two day ' time he and the Wazir 's son walk in the garden , and there they see a large , lovely red fruit . `` oh ! '' say the Prince , `` I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit . '' Husain Mahamat want he to gather it and see , but he would not till he have tell he father , who say , `` that must be the fruit ; go and gather it . '' so Majnun go back and break the fruit off its stalk ; and he say to he father , `` come with I to my room while I open it ; I be afraid to open it alone , for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that will eat I . '' `` no , '' say King Dantal ; `` remember , Laili will be naked ; you must go alone and do not be afraid if , after all , a Rakshas be in the fruit , for I will stay outside the door , and you have only to call I with a loud voice , and I will come to you , so the RakshasS will not be able to eat you . '' then Majnun take the fruit and begin to cut it open tremblingly , for he shake with fear ; and when he have cut it , out step Laili , young and far more beautiful than she have ever be . at the sight of she extreme beauty , Majnun fall backwards faint on the floor . Laili take off he turban and wind it all round herself like a sari -lrb-B- for she have no clothes at all on -rrb-B- , and then she call King Dantal , and say to he sadly , `` why have majnun fall down like this ? why will he not speak to I ? he never use to be afraid of I ; and he have see I so many , many time . '' King Dantal answer , `` it be because you be so beautiful . you be far , far more beautiful than you ever be . but he will be very happy directly . '' then the King get some water , and they bath Majnun 's face and give he some to drink , and he sit up again . then Laili say , `` why do you faint ? do you not see I be Laili ? '' `` oh ! '' say Prince Majnun , `` I see you be Laili come back to I , but you eye have grow so wonderfully beautiful , that I faint when I see they . '' then they be all very happy , and King Dantal have all the drum in the place beat , and have all the musical instrument play on , and they make a grand wedding-feast , and give present to the servant , and rice and quantity of rupee to the fakir . after some time have pass very happily , Prince Majnun and he wife go out to eat the air . they ride on the same horse , and have only a groom with they . they come to another kingdom , to a beautiful garden . `` we must go into that garden and see it , '' say Majnun . `` no , no , '' say Laili ; `` it belong to a bad Raja , Chumman Basa , a very wicked man . '' but Majnun insist on go in , and in spite of all Laili could say , he get off the horse to look at the flower . now , as he be look at the flower , Laili see Chumman Basa come towards they , and she read in he eye that he mean to kill she husband and seize she . so she say to Majnun , `` come , come , let we go ; do not go near that bad man . I see in he eye , and I feel in my heart , that he will kill you to seize I . '' `` what nonsense , '' say Majnun . `` I believe he be a very good raja . Anyhow , I be so near to he that I could not get away . '' `` well , '' say Laili , `` it be better that you should be kill than I , for if I be to be kill a second time , Khuda would not give I my life again ; but I can bring you to life if you be kill . '' now Chumman Basa have come quite near , and seem very pleasant , so think Prince Majnun ; but when he be speak to Majnun , he draw he scimitar and cut off the prince 's head at one blow . Laili sit quite still on she horse , and as the Raja come towards she she say , `` why do you kill my husband ? '' `` because I want to take you , '' he answer . `` you can not , '' say Laili . `` yes , I can , '' say the Raja . `` take I , then , '' say Laili to Chumman Basa ; so he come quite close and put out he hand to take hers to lift she off she horse . but she put she hand in she pocket and pull out a tiny knife , only as long as she hand be broad , and this knife unfold itself in one instant till it be such a length ! and then Laili make a great sweep with she arm and she long , long knife , and off come Chumman Basa 's head at one touch . then Laili slip down off she horse , and she go to Majnun 's dead body , and she cut she little finger inside she hand straight down from the top of she nail to she palm , and out of this gush blood like heal medicine . then she put Majnun 's head on he shoulder , and smear she healing blood all over the wound , and Majnun wake up and say , `` what a delightful sleep I have have ! why , I feel as if I have sleep for year ! '' then he get up and see the Raja 's dead body by Laili 's horse . `` what be that ? '' say Majnun . `` that be the wicked Raja who kill you to seize I , just as I say he would . '' `` who kill he ? '' ask Majnun . `` I do , '' answer Laili , `` and it be I who bring you to life . '' `` do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so , '' say Majnun . `` no , '' say Laili , `` for he be a wicked man , and will try to do you harm . '' but Majnun ask she for such a long time , and so earnestly to bring the wicked raja to life , that at least she say , `` jump up on the horse , then , and go far away with the groom . '' `` what will you do , '' say Majnun , `` if I leave you ? I can not leave you . '' `` I will take care of myself , '' say Laili ; `` but this man be so wicked , he may kill you again if you be near he . '' so Majnun get up on the horse , and he and the groom go a long way off and wait for Laili . then she set the wicked Raja 's head straight on he shoulder , and she squeeze the wound in she finger till a little blood-medicine come out of it . then she smear this over the place where she knife have pass , and just as she see the Raja open he eye , she begin to run , and she run , and run so fast , that she outrun the Raja , who try to catch she ; and she spring up on the horse behind she husband , and they ride so fast , so fast , till they reach King Dantal 's palace . there Prince Majnun tell everything to he father , who be horrify and angry . `` how lucky for you that you have such a wife , '' he say . `` why do you not do what she tell you ? but for she , you would be now dead . '' then he make a great feast out of gratitude for he son 's safety , and give many , many rupee to the fakir . and he make so much of Laili . he love she dearly ; he could not do enough for she . then he build a splendid palace for she and he son , with a great deal of ground about it , and lovely garden , and give they great wealth , and heap of servant to wait on they . but he would not allow any but they servant to enter they garden and palace , and he would not allow Majnun to go out of they , nor Laili ; `` for , '' say King Dantal , `` Laili be so beautiful , that perhaps some one may kill my son to take she away .
