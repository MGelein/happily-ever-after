'' then he say to the parrot , `` who be the Princess Labam ? where do she live ? '' but the parrot would not tell he where she live . `` you can never get to the Princess Labam 's country . '' that be all they would say . the prince grow very sad when they would not tell he anything more ; and he throw he gun away , and go home . when he get home , he would not speak or eat , but lay on he bed for four or five day , and seem very ill. . at last he tell he father and mother that he want to go and see the Princess Labam . `` I must go , '' he say ; `` I must see what she be like . tell I where she country be .

Stay with we . you will never find the Princess Labam . '' `` I must try and find she , '' say the prince . `` perhaps God will show I the way . if I live and I find she , I will come back to you ; but perhaps I shall die , and then I shall never see you again . still I must go . '' so they have to let he go , though they cry very much at parting with he . he father give he fine clothes to wear , and a fine horse . and he take he gun , and he bow and arrow , and a great many other weapon , `` for , '' he say , `` I may want they . '' he father , too , give he plenty of rupee . then he himself get he horse all ready for the journey , and he say good-bye to he father and mother ; and he mother take she handkerchief and wrap some sweetmeat in it , and give it to she son . `` my child , '' she say to he , `` when you be hungry eat some of these sweetmeat . '' he then set out on he journey , and ride on and on till he come to a jungle in which be a tank and shady tree . he bath himself and he horse in the tank , and then sit down under a tree . `` now , '' he say to himself , `` I will eat some of the sweetmeat my mother give I , and I will drink some water , and then I will continue my journey . '' he open he handkerchief , and take out a sweetmeat . he find a ant in it . he take out another . there be a ant in that one too . so he lay the two sweetmeat on the ground , and he take out another , and another , and another , until he have take they all out ; but in each he find a ant . `` never mind , '' he say , `` I will not eat the sweetmeat ; the ant shall eat they . '' then the Ant-Raja come and stand before he and say , `` you have be good to we . if ever you be in trouble , think of I and we will come to you . '' the Raja 's son thank he , mount he horse and continue he journey . he ride on and on until he come to another jungle , and there he see a tiger who have a thorn in he foot , and be roar loudly from the pain . `` why do you roar like that ? '' say the young Raja . `` what be the matter with you ? '' `` I have have a thorn in my foot for twelve year , '' answer the tiger , `` and it hurt I so ; that be why I roar . '' `` well , '' say the Raja 's son , `` I will take it out for you . but perhaps , as you be a tiger , when I have make you well , you will eat I ? '' `` oh , no , '' say the tiger , `` I will not eat you . do make I well . '' then the prince take a little knife from he pocket , and cut the thorn out of the tiger 's foot ; but when he cut , the tiger roar louder than ever -- so loud that he wife hear he in the next jungle , and come bound along to see what be the matter . the tiger see she coming , and hide the prince in the jungle , so that she should not see he . `` what man hurt you that you roar so loud ?

'' but the prince would not listen to anything she say . the king send for the prince to the old woman 's house , and he servant bring the Raja 's son to the king 's court-house to the king . there the king give he eighty pound of mustard seed , and tell he to crush all the oil out of it that day , and bring it next morning to he to the court-house . `` whoever wish to marry my daughter , '' he say to the prince , `` must first do all I tell he . if he can not , then I have he kill . so if you can not crush all the oil out of this mustard seed , you will die . '' the prince be very sorry when he hear this . `` how can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day ? '' he say to himself ; `` and if I do not , the king will kill I . '' he take the mustard seed to the old woman 's house , and do not know what to do . at last he remember the Ant-Raja , and the moment he do so , the Ant-Raja and he ant come to he . `` why do you look so sad ? '' say the Ant-Raja . the prince show he the mustard seed , and say to he , `` how can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day ? and if I do not take the oil to the king to-morrow morning , he will kill I . '' `` be happy , '' say the Ant-Raja ; `` lie down and sleep ; we will crush all the oil out for you during the day , and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the king . '' the Raja 's son lay down and sleep , and the ant crush out the oil for he . the prince be very glad when he see the oil . the next morning he take it to the court-house to the king . but the king say , `` you can not yet marry my daughter . if you wish to do so , you must first fight with my two demon and kill they .

'' when he hear of the demon the Raja 's son be very sad . `` what can I do ? '' he say to himself . `` how can I fight with these two demon ? '' then he think of he tiger : and the tiger and he wife come to he and say , `` why be you so sad ? '' the Raja 's son answer , `` the king have order I to fight with he two demon and kill they . how can I do this ? '' `` do not be frighten , '' say the tiger . `` be happy . I and my wife will fight with they for you . '' then the Raja 's son take out of he bag two splendid coat . they be all gold and silver , and cover with pearl and diamond . these he put on the tiger to make they beautiful , and he take they to the king , and say to he , `` May these tiger fight you demon for I ? '' `` yes , '' say the king , who do not care in the least who kill he demon , provide they be kill . `` then call you demon , '' say the Raja 's son , `` and these tiger will fight they . '' the king do so , and the tiger and the demon fight and fight until the tiger have kill the demon . `` that be good , '' say the king . `` but you must do something else before I give you my daughter . up in the sky I have a kettle-drum . you must go and beat it . if you can not do this , I will kill you . '' the Raja 's son thought of he little bed ; so he go to the old woman 's house and sit on he bed . `` little bed , '' he say , `` up in the sky be the king 's kettle-drum . I want to go to it . '' the bed fly up with he , and the Raja 's son beat the drum , and the king hear he . still , when he come down , the king would not give he he daughter . `` you have , '' he say to the prince , `` do the three thing I tell you to do ; but you must do one thing more . '' `` if I can , I will , '' say the Raja 's son . then the king show he the trunk of a tree that be lie near he court-house . it be a very , very thick trunk . he give the prince a wax hatchet , and say , `` tomorrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet . '' the Raja 's son go back to the old woman 's house . he be very sad , and think that now the Raja would certainly kill he . `` I have he oil crush out by the ant , '' he say to himself . `` I have he demon kill by the tiger . my bed help I to beat he kettle-drum . but now what can I do ? how can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet ? '' at night he go on he bed to see the princess . `` to-morrow , '' he say to she , `` you father will kill I . '' `` why ? '' ask the princess . `` he have tell I to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet . how can I ever do that ? '' say the Raja 's son . `` do not be afraid , '' say the princess ; `` do as I bid you , and you will cut it in two quite easily . '' then she pull out a hair from she head , and give it to the prince . `` to-morrow , '' she say , `` when no one be near you , you must say to the tree-trunk , ` the Princess Labam command you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair . ' then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet 's blade . '' the prince next day do exactly as the princess have tell he ; and the minute the hair that be stretch down the edge of the hatchet-blade touch the tree-trunk it split into two piece . the king say , `` now you can marry my daughter . '' then the wedding take place . all the RajasS and king of the country round be ask to come to it , and there be great rejoicing . after a few day the prince 's son say to he wife , `` let we go to my father 's country . '' the Princess Labam 's father give they a quantity of camel and horse and rupee and servant ; and they travel in great state to the prince 's country , where they live happily . the prince always keep he bag , bowl , bed , and stick ; only , as no one ever come to make war on he , he never need to use the stick .
