'' `` ah , wife , '' say the man , `` the cottage be quite good enough ; why should we live in a castle ? '' `` what ! '' say the woman ; `` just go there , the Flounder can always do that .

'' the man 's heart grow heavy , and he would not go . he say to himself , `` it be not right , '' and yet he go . and when he come to the sea the water be quite purple and dark-blue , and gray and thick , and no longer so green and yellow , but it be still quiet . and he stand there and say -- `` flounder , flounder in the sea , come , I pray thee , here to I ; for my wife , good Ilsabil , Wills not as I would have she will . '' `` well , what do she want , then ? '' say the Flounder . `` Alas , '' say the man , half scared , `` she want to live in a great stone castle .

'' `` ah , wife , '' say the man , `` why should we be King ? I do not want to be King . '' `` well , '' say the wife , `` if you will not be King , I will ; go to the Flounder , for I will be King . '' `` ah , wife , '' say the man , `` why do you want to be King ? I do not like to say that to he . '' `` why not ? '' say the woman ; `` go to he this instant ; I must be King ! '' so the man go , and be quite unhappy because he wife wish to be King . `` it be not right ; it be not right , '' think he . he do not wish to go , but yet he go . and when he come to the sea , it be quite dark-grey , and the water heave up from below , and smell putrid . then he go and stand by it , and say , `` flounder , flounder in the sea , come , I pray thee , here to I ; for my wife , good Ilsabil , Wills not as I would have she will '' `` well , what do she want , then ? '' say the Flounder . `` Alas , '' say the man , `` she want to be King . '' `` go to she ; she be King already . '' so the man go , and when he come to the palace , the castle have become much larger , and have a great tower and magnificent ornament , and the sentinel be stand before the door , and there be number of soldier with kettle-drums and trumpet . and when he go inside the house , everything be of real marble and gold , with velvet cover and great golden tassel . then the door of the hall be open , and there be the court in all its splendor , and he wife be sit on a high throne of gold and diamond , with a great crown of gold on she head , and a sceptre of pure gold and jewel in she hand , and on both side of she stand she maids-in-waiting in a row , each of they always one head shorter than the last . then he go and stand before she , and say , `` ah , wife , and now you be King . '' `` yes , '' say the woman , `` now I be King . '' so he stand and look at she , and when he have look at she thus for some time , he say , `` and now that you be King , let all else be , now we will wish for nothing more . '' `` Nay , husband , '' say the woman , quite anxiously , `` I find time pass very heavily , I can bear it no longer ; go to the Flounder -- I be King , but I must be Emperor , too . '' `` Alas , wife , why do you wish to be Emperor ? '' `` Husband , '' say she , `` go to the Flounder . I will be Emperor . '' `` Alas , wife , '' say the man , `` he can not make you Emperor ; I may not say that to the fish . there be only one Emperor in the land . a Emperor the Flounder can not make you ! I assure you he can not . '' `` what ! '' say the woman , `` I be the King , and you be nothing but my husband ; will you go this moment ? go at once ! if he can make a king he can make a emperor . I will be Emperor ; go instantly . '' so he be force to go . as the man go , however , he be trouble in mind , and think to himself , `` it will not end well ; it will not end well ! Emperor be too shameless ! the Flounder will at last be tire out . '' with that he reach the sea , and the sea be quite black and thick , and begin to boil up from below , so that it throw up bubble , and such a sharp wind blow over it that it curdle , and the man be afraid . then he go and stand by it , and say , `` flounder , flounder in the sea , come , I pray thee , here to I ; for my wife , good Ilsabil , Wills not as I would have she will . '' `` well , what do she want , then ? '' say the Flounder . `` Alas , Flounder , '' say he , `` my wife want to be Emperor . '' `` go to she , '' say the Flounder ; `` she be Emperor already . '' so the man go , and when he get there the whole palace be make of polished marble with alabaster figure and golden ornament , and soldier be march before the door blowing trumpet , and beating cymbal and drum ; and in the house , baron , and count , and duke be go about as servant . then they open the door to he , which be of pure gold . and when he enter , there sit he wife on a throne , which be make of one piece of gold , and be quite two mile high ; and she wear a great golden crown that be three yard high , and set with diamond and carbuncle , and in one hand she have the sceptre , and in the other the imperial orb ; and on both side of she stand the yeoman of the guard in two row , each be smaller than the one before he , from the biggest giant , who be two mile high , to the very smallest dwarf , just as big as my little finger . and before it stand a number of prince and duke . then the man go and stand among they , and say , `` wife , be you Emperor now ? '' `` yes , '' say she , `` now I be Emperor . '' then he stand and look at she well , and when he have look at she thus for some time , he say , `` ah , wife , be content , now that you be Emperor . '' `` Husband , '' say she , `` why be you stand there ? now , I be Emperor , but I will be Pope too ; go to the Flounder . '' `` Alas , wife , '' say the man , `` what will you not wish for ? you can not be Pope . there be but one in Christendom . he can not make you Pope . '' `` Husband , '' say she , `` I will be Pope ; go immediately , I must be Pope this very day . '' `` no , wife , '' say the man , `` I do not like to say that to he ; that would not do , it be too much ; the Flounder can not make you Pope . '' `` Husband , '' say she , `` what nonsense ! if he can make a emperor he can make a pope . go to he directly . I be Emperor , and you be nothing but my husband ; will you go at once ? '' then he be afraid and go ; but he be quite faint , and shiver and shake , and he knee and leg tremble . and a high wind blow over the land , and the cloud fly , and towards evening all grow dark , and the leaf fall from the tree , and the water rise and roar as if it be boil , and splash upon the shore . and in the distance he see ship which be firing gun in they sore need , pitching and toss on the wave . and yet in the midst of the sky there be still a small bit of blue , though on every side it be as red as in a heavy storm . so , full of despair , he go and stand in much fear and say , `` flounder , flounder in the sea , come , I pray thee , here to I ; '' for my wife , good Ilsabil , Wills not as I would have she will . `` well , what do she want , then ? '' say the Flounder . `` Alas , '' say the man , `` she want to be Pope . '' `` go to she then , '' say the Flounder ; `` she be Pope already . '' so he go , and when he get there , he see what seem to be a large church surround by palace . he push he way through the crowd . inside , however , everything be light up with thousand and thousand of candle , and he wife be clothe in gold , and she be sit on a much higher throne , and have three great golden crown on , and round about she there be much ecclesiastical splendor ; and on both side of she be a row of candle the largest of which be as tall as the very tallest tower , down to the very smallest kitchen candle , and all the emperor and king be on they knee before she , kiss she shoe . `` wife , '' say the man , and look attentively at she , `` be you now Pope ? '' `` yes , '' say she , `` I be Pope . '' so he stand and look at she , and it be just as if he be look at the bright sun . when he have stand look at she thus for a short time , he say , `` ah , wife , if you be Pope , do let well alone ! '' but she look as stiff as a post , and do not move or show any sign of life . then say he , `` wife , now that you be Pope , be satisfy , you can not become anything greater now . '' `` I will consider about that , '' say the woman . Thereupon they both go to bed , but she be not satisfied , and greediness let she have no sleep , for she be continually think what there be leave for she to be . the man sleep well and soundly , for he have run about a great deal during the day ; but the woman could not fall asleep at all , and fling herself from one side to the other the whole night through , think always what more be leave for she to be , but unable to call to mind anything else . at length the sun begin to rise , and when the woman see the red of dawn , she sit up in bed and look at it . and when , through the window , she see the sun thus rise , she say , `` can not I , too , order the sun and moon to rise ? '' `` Husband , '' she say , poke he in the rib with she elbow , `` wake up ! go to the Flounder , for I wish to be even as God be . '' the man be still half asleep , but he be so horrify that he fall out of bed . he think he must have hear amiss , and rub he eye , and say , `` Alas , wife , what be you say ? '' `` Husband , '' say she , `` if I can not order the sun and moon to rise , and have to look on and see the sun and moon rising , I can not bear it . I shall not know what it be to have another happy hour , unless I can make they rise myself . '' then she look at he so terribly that a shudder run over he , and say , `` go at once ; I wish to be like unto God . '' `` Alas , wife , '' say the man , fall on he knee before she , `` the Flounder can not do that ; he can make a emperor and a pope ; I beseech you , go on as you be , and be Pope . '' then she fall into a rage , and she hair fly wildly about she head , and she cry , `` I will not endure this , I 'll not bear it any longer ; wilt thou go ? '' then he put on he trousers and run away like a madman . but outside a great storm be rage , and blow so hard that he could scarcely keep he foot ; house and tree topple over , the mountain tremble , rock roll into the sea , the sky be pitch black , and it thunder and lighten , and the sea come in with black wave as high as church-towers and mountain , and all with crest of white foam at the top . then he cry , but could not hear he own word , `` flounder , flounder in the sea , come , I pray thee , here to I ; for my wife , good Ilsabil , Wills not as I would have she will . '' `` well , what do she want , then ? '' say the Flounder . `` Alas , '' say he , `` she want to be like unto God . '' `` go to she , and you will find she back again in the dirty hovel . '' and there they be live still at this very time .
