'' `` oh , but you be speak in ignorance , '' answer the man ; `` with I you would learn a very different kind of tailor , which be respectable and proper , and for the most part very honorable . '' so he let himself be persuade , and go with the man , and learn he art from the very begin . when they part , the man give the youth a needle , and say , `` with this you can sew together whatever be give you , whether it be as soft as a egg or as hard as steel ; and it will all become one piece of stuff , so that no seam will be visible . '' when the appoint four year be over , the four brother arrive at the same time at the cross-roads , embrace and kiss each other , and return home to they father . `` so now , '' say he , quite delighted , `` the wind have blow you back again to I . '' they tell he of all that have happen to they , and that each have learn he own trade . now they be sit just in front of the house under a large tree , and the father say , `` I will put you all to the test , and see what you can do . '' then he look up and say to he second son , `` between two branch up at the top of this tree , there be a chaffinch 's nest , tell I how many egg there be in it ? '' the astronomer take he glass , look up , and say , `` there be five . '' then the father say to the eldest , `` fetch the egg down without disturb the bird which be sit hatch they . '' the skillful thief climb up , and take the five egg from beneath the bird , which never observe what he be do , and remain quietly sit where she be , and bring they down to he father . the father take they , and put one of they on each corner of the table , and the fifth in the middle , and say to the huntsman , `` with one shot thou shalt shoot I the five egg in two , through the middle . '' the huntsman aim , and shoot the egg , all five as the father have desire , and that at one shot . he certainly must have have some of the powder for shooting round corner . `` now it be you turn , '' say the father to the fourth son ; `` you shall sew the egg together again , and the young bird that be inside they as well , and you must do it so that they be not hurt by the shot . '' the tailor bring he needle , and sew they as he father wish . when he have do this the thief have to climb up the tree again , and carry they to the nest , and put they back again under the bird without she be aware of it . the bird sit she full time , and after a few day the young one creep out , and they have a red line round they neck where they have be sewn together by the tailor . `` well , '' say the old man to he son , `` I begin to think you be worth more than breen clover ; you have use you time well , and learn something good . I can not say which of you deserve the most praise . that will be prove if you have but a early opportunity of use you talent . '' not long after this , there be a great uproar in the country , for the King 's daughter be carry off by a dragon . the King be full of trouble about it , both by day and night , and cause it to be proclaim that whosoever bring she back should have she to wife . the four brother say to each other , `` this would be a fine opportunity for we to show what we can do ! '' and resolve to go forth together and liberate the King 's daughter . `` I will soon know where she be , '' say the astronomer , and look through he telescope and say , `` I see she already , she be far away from here on a rock in the sea , and the dragon be beside she watch she . '' then he go to the King , and ask for a ship for himself and he brother , and sail with they over the sea until they come to the rock . there the King 's daughter be sit , and the dragon be lie asleep on she lap . the huntsman say , `` I dare not fire , I should kill the beautiful maiden at the same time . '' `` then I will try my art , '' say the thief , and he creep thither and steal she away from under the dragon , so quietly and dexterously , that the monster never remark it , but go on snore . Full of joy , they hurry off with she on board ship , and steer out into the open sea ; but the dragon , who when he awake have find no princess there , follow they , and come snort angrily through the air . just as he be circle above the ship , and about to descend on it , the huntsman shoulder he gun , and shoot he to the heart . the monster fall down dead , but be so large and powerful that he fall shatter the whole ship . fortunately , however , they lay hold of a couple of plank , and swim about the wide sea . then again they be in great peril , but the tailor , who be not idle , take he wondrous needle , and with a few stitch sew the plank together , and they seat themselves upon they , and collect together all the fragment of the vessel . then he sew these so skilfully together , that in a very short time the ship be once more seaworthy , and they could go home again in safety . when the King once more see he daughter , there be great rejoicing . he say to the four brother , `` one of you shall have she to wife , but which of you it be to be you must settle among yourselve . '' then a warm contest arise among they , for each of they prefer he own claim . the astronomer say , `` if I have not see the princess , all you art would have be useless , so she be mine . '' the thief say , `` what would have be the use of you see , if I have not get she away from the dragon ? so she be mine . '' the huntsman say , `` you and the princess , and all of you , would have be tear to piece by the dragon if my ball have not hit he , so she be mine . '' the tailor say , `` and if I , by my art , have not sew the ship together again , you would all of you have be miserably drowned , so she be mine . '' then the King utter this saying , `` each of you have a equal right , and as all of you can not have the maiden , none of you shall have she , but I will give to each of you , as a reward , half a kingdom . '' the brother be please with this decision , and say , `` it be better thus than that we should be at variance with each other . '' then each of they receive half a kingdom , and they live with they father in the greatest happiness as long as it please God .
