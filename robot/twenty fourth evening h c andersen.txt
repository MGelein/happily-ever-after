TWENTY-FOURTH EVENING . H. C. Andersen `` I will now give you a picture from Frankfort , '' say the moon . `` I especially notice one building there . it be not the house in which Goethe be bear , nor the old Council House , through whose grated window peer the horn of the ox that be roasted and give to the people when the emperor be crown . no , it be a private house , plain in appearance , and painted green . it stand near the old jew ' street . it be Rothschild 's house . `` I look through the open door . the staircase be brilliantly light : servant carry wax candle in massive silver candlestick stand there , and bow low before a old woman , who be be bring downstairs in a litter . the proprietor of the house stand bare-headed , and respectfully imprint a kiss on the hand of the old woman . she be he mother . she nod in a friendly manner to he and to the servant , and they carry she into the dark narrow street , into a little house , that be she dwelling . here she child have be bear , from hence the fortune of the family have arise . if she desert the despise street and the little house , fortune would also desert she child . that be she firm belief . '' the Moon tell I no more ; he visit this evening be far too short . but I think of the old woman in the narrow despise street . it would have cost she but a word , and a brilliant house would have arise for she on the bank of the Thames -- a word , and a villa would have be prepare in the Bay of Naples . `` if I desert the lowly house , where the fortune of my son first begin to bloom , fortune would desert they ! '' it be a superstition , but a superstition of such a class , that he who know the story and have see this picture , need have only two word place under the picture to make he understand it ; and these two word be : `` a mother .
