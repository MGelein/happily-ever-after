'' by trade he be a shoemaker , and when he work he pull he thread out with such force that he drive he fist into every one who do not keep far enough off . no apprentice stay more than a month with he , for he have always some fault to find with the very best work . at one time it be that the stitch be not even , at another that one shoe be too long , or one heel higher than the other , or the leather not cut large enough . `` wait , '' say he to he apprentice , `` I will soon show thee how we make skin soft , '' and he bring a strap and give he a couple of stroke across the back . he call they all sluggard . he himself do not turn much work out of he hand , for he never sit still for a quarter of a hour . if he wife get up very early in the morning and light the fire , he jump out of bed , and run bare-footed into the kitchen , cry , `` wilt thou burn my house down for I ? that be a fire one could roast a ox by ! Does wood cost nothing ? '' if the servant be stand by they wash-tubs and laughing , and tell each other all they know , he scold they , and say , `` there stand the goose cackling , and forget they work , to gossip ! and why fresh soap ? disgraceful extravagance and shameful idleness into the bargain ! they want to save they hand , and not rub the thing properly ! '' and out he would run and knock a pail full of soap and water over , so that the whole kitchen be flood . someone be build a new house , so he hurry to the window to look on . `` there , they be use that red sand-stone again that never dry ! '' cry he . `` no one will ever be healthy in that house ! and just look how badly the fellow be lay the stone ! besides , the mortar be good for nothing ! it ought to have gravel in it , not sand . I shall live to see that house tumble down on the people who be in it . '' he sit down , put a couple of stitch in , and then jump up again , unfasten he leather-apron , and cry , `` I will just go out , and appeal to those man 's conscience . '' he stumble on the carpenter . `` what be this ? '' cry he , `` you be not work by the line ! Do you expect the beam to be straight ? -- one wrong will put all wrong . '' he snatch a axe out of a carpenter 's hand and want to show he how he ought to cut ; but as a cart load with clay come by , he throw the axe away , and hasten to the peasant who be walk by the side of it : `` you be not in you right mind , '' say he , `` who yoke young horse to a heavily-laden cart ? the poor beast will die on the spot . '' the peasant do not give he a answer , and Pfriem in a rage run back into he workshop . when he be set himself to work again , the apprentice reach he a shoe . `` well , what be that again ? '' scream he , `` have not I tell you you ought not to cut shoe so broad ? who would buy a shoe like this , which be hardly anything else but a sole ? I insist on my order be follow exactly . '' `` Master , '' answer the apprentice , `` you may easily be quite right about the shoe be a bad one , but it be the one which you yourself cut out , and yourself set to work at . when you jump up a while since , you knock it off the table , and I have only just pick it up . a angel from heaven , however , would never make you believe that . '' one night Master Pfriem dream he be dead , and on he way to heaven . when he get there , he knock loudly at the door . `` I wonder , '' say he to himself , `` that they have no knocker on the door , -- one knock one 's knuckle sore . '' the apostle Peter open the door , and want to see who demand admission so noisily . `` ah , it be you , Master Pfriem ; '' say he , `` well , I 'll let you in , but I warn you that you must give up that habit of yours , and find fault with nothing you see in heaven , or you may fare ill. '' `` you might have spare you warning , '' answer Pfriem . `` I know already what be seemly , and here , God be thank , everything be perfect , and there be nothing to blame as there be on earth . '' so he go in , and walk up and down the wide expanse of heaven . he look around he , to the left and to the right , but sometimes shake he head , or muttered something to himself . then he see two angel who be carry away a beam . it be the beam which some one have have in he own eye whilst he be look for the splinter in the eye of another . they do not , however , carry the beam lengthway , but obliquely . `` do any one ever see such a piece of stupidity ? '' thought Master Pfriem ; but he say nothing , and seem satisfied with it . `` it come to the same thing after all , whichever way they carry the beam , straight or crooked , if they only get along with it , and truly I do not see they knock against anything . '' soon after this he see two angel who be draw water out of a well into a bucket , but at the same time he observe that the bucket be full of hole , and that the water be run out of it on every side . they be water the earth with rain . `` Hang it , '' he exclaim ; but happily recollect himself , and think , `` perhaps it be only a pastime . if it be a amusement , then it seem they can do useless thing of this kind even here in heaven , where people , as I have already notice , do nothing but idle about . '' he go farther and see a cart which have stick fast in a deep hole . `` it be no wonder , '' say he to the man who stand by it ; `` who would load so unreasonably ? what have you there ? '' `` good wish , '' reply the man , `` I could not go along the right way with it , but still I have push it safely up here , and they will not leave I stick here . '' in fact a angel do come and harness two horse to it . `` that be quite right , '' think Pfriem , `` but two horse will not get that cart out , it must at least have four to it . '' another angel come and bring two more horse ; she do not , however , harness they in front of it , but behind . that be too much for Master Pfriem , `` clumsy creature , '' he burst out with , `` what be you do there ? have any one ever since the world begin see a cart draw in that way ? but you , in you conceited arrogance , think that you know everything best . '' he be go to say more , but one of the inhabitant of heaven seize he by the throat and push he forth with irresistible strength . beneath the gateway Master Pfriem turn he head round to take one more look at the cart , and see that it be be raise into the air by four wing horse . at this moment Master Pfriem awake . `` thing be certainly arrange in heaven otherwise than they be on earth , '' say he to himself , `` and that excuse much ; but who can see horse harness both behind and before with patience ; to be sure they have wing , but who could know that ? it be , besides , great folly to fix a pair of wing to a horse that have four leg to run with already ! but I must get up , or else they will make nothing but mistake for I in my house . it be a lucky thing for I though , that I be not really dead .
