'' she change he into a ant and say , `` Creep into the fold of my dress , you will be safe there . '' `` yes , '' answer he , `` so far , so good ; but there be three thing besides that I want to know : why a fountain which once flow with wine have become dry , and no longer give even water ; why a tree which once bear golden apple do not even put forth leave ; and why a ferry-man must always be go backwards and forwards , and be never set free ? '' `` those be difficult question , '' answer she , `` but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil say when I pull out the three golden hair . '' as the evening come on , the devil return home . no sooner have he enter than he notice that the air be not pure . `` I smell man 's flesh , '' say he ; `` all be not right here . '' then he pry into every corner , and search , but could not find anything . he grandmother scold he . `` it have just be sweep , '' say she , `` and everything put in order , and now you be upset it again ; you have always get man 's flesh in you nose . Sit down and eat you supper . '' when he have eat and drunk he be tire , and lay he head in he grandmother 's lap , and before long he be fast asleep , snore and breathe heavily . then the old woman take hold of a golden hair , pull it out , and lay it down near she . `` oh ! '' cry the devil , `` what be you do ? '' `` I have have a bad dream , '' answer the grandmother , `` so I seize hold of you hair . '' `` what do you dream then ? '' say the devil . `` I dream that a fountain in a market-place from which wine once flow be dry up , and not even water would flow out of it ; what be the cause of it ? '' `` oh , ho ! if they do but know it , '' answer the devil ; `` there be a toad sit under a stone in the well ; if they kill it , the wine would flow again . '' he go to sleep again and snore until the window shake . then she pull the second hair out . `` ha ! what be you do ? '' cry the devil angrily . `` do not take it ill , '' say she , `` I do it in a dream . '' `` what have you dream this time ? '' ask he . `` I dream that in a certain kingdom there stand a apple-tree which have once bear golden apple , but now would not even bear leaf . what , think you , be the reason ? '' `` oh ! if they do but know , '' answer the devil . `` a mouse be gnawing at the root ; if they kill this they would have golden apple again , but if it gnaw much longer the tree will wither altogether . but leave I alone with you dream : if you disturb I in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear . '' the grandmother speak gently to he until he fall asleep again and snore . then she take hold of the third golden hair and pull it out . the devil jump up , roar out , and would have treat she ill if she have not quiet he once more and say , `` who can help bad dream ? '' `` what be the dream , then ? '' ask he , and be quite curious . `` I dream of a ferry-man who complain that he must always ferry from one side to the other , and be never release . what be the cause of it ? '' `` ah ! the fool , '' answer the devil ; `` when any one come and want to go across he must put the oar in he hand , and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free . '' as the grandmother have pluck out the three golden hair , and the three question be answer , she let the old serpent alone , and he sleep until daybreak . when the devil have go out again the old woman take the ant out of the fold of she dress , and give the luck-child he human shape again . `` there be the three golden hair for you , '' say she . `` what the Devil say to you three question , I suppose you hear ? '' `` yes , '' answer he , `` I hear , and will take care to remember . '' `` you have what you want , '' say she , `` and now you can go you way . '' he thank the old woman for help he in he need , and leave hell well content that everything have turn out so fortunately . when he come to the ferry-man he be expect to give the promised answer . `` Ferry I across first , '' say the luck-child , `` and then I will tell you how you can be set free , '' and when he reach the opposite shore he give he the devil 's advice : `` next time any one come , who want to be ferry over , just put the oar in he hand . '' he go on and come to the town wherein stand the unfruitful tree , and there too the watchman want a answer . so he tell he what he have hear from the devil : `` kill the mouse which be gnawing at its root , and it will again bear golden apple . '' then the watchman thank he , and give he as a reward two ass laden with gold , which follow he . at last he come to the town whose well be dry . he tell the watchman what the devil have say : `` a toad be in the well beneath a stone ; you must find it and kill it , and the well will again give wine in plenty . '' the watchman thank he , and also give he two ass laden with gold . at last the luck-child get home to he wife , who be heartily glad to see he again , and to hear how well he have prosper in everything . to the King he take what he have ask for , the devil 's three golden hair , and when the King see the four ass laden with gold he be quite content , and say , `` now all the condition be fulfil , and you can keep my daughter . but tell I , dear son-in-law , where do all that gold come from ? this be tremendous wealth ! '' `` I be row across a river , '' answer he , `` and get it there ; it lie on the shore instead of sand . '' `` can I too fetch some of it ? '' say the King ; and he be quite eager about it . `` as much as you like , '' answer he . `` there be a ferry-man on the river ; let he ferry you over , and you can fill you sack on the other side . '' the greedy king set out in all haste , and when he come to the river he beckon to the ferry-man to put he across . the ferry-man come and bid he get in , and when they get to the other shore he put the oar in he hand and spring out . but from this time forth the King have to ferry , as a punishment for he sin . perhaps he be ferry still ? if he be , it be because no one have take the oar from he .
