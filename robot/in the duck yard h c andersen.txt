in the duck-yard . H. C. Andersen a duck arrive from Portugal . some say she come from Spain , but that be all the same . at any rate she be call the Portuguese , and lay egg , and be kill and cook , and that be _ she _ career . but the duckling which creep forth from she egg be afterwards also call Portuguese , and there be something in that . now , of the whole family there be only one left in the duck-yard , a yard to which the chicken have access likewise , and where the cock strut about in a very aggressive manner . `` he annoy I with he loud crowing ! '' observe the Portuguese duck . `` but he be a handsome bird , there be no deny that , though he be not a drake . he ought to moderate he voice , but that be a art inseparable from polite education , like that possess by the little singing bird over in the lime tree in the neighbour 's garden . how charmingly they sing ! there be something quite pretty in they warbling . I call it Portugal . if I have only such a little singing bird , I would be a mother to he , kind and good , for that be in my blood , my portuguese blood ! '' and while she be still speak , a little singing bird come head over heel from the roof into the yard . the cat be behind he , but the bird escape with a broken wing , and that be how he come tumble into the yard . `` that be just like the cat ; she be a villain ! '' say the Portuguese duck . `` I remember she way when I have child of my own . that such a creature should be allow to live , and to wander about upon the roof ! I do not think they do such thing in Portugal ! '' and she pity the little singing bird , and the other duck who be not of Portuguese descent pity he too . `` Poor little creature ! '' they say , as one after another come up . `` we certainly can not sing , '' they say , `` but we have a sound board , or something of the kind , within we ; we can feel that , though we do not talk of it . '' `` but I can talk of it , '' say the Portuguese duck ; `` and I 'll do something for the little fellow , for that be my duty ! '' and she step into the water-trough , and beat she wing upon the water so heartily , that the little singing bird be almost drown by the bath she get , but the duck mean it kindly . `` that be a good deed , '' she say : `` the other may take example by it . '' `` piep ! '' say the little bird ; one of he wing be break , and he find it difficult to shake himself ; but he quite understand that the bath be kindly mean . `` you be very kind-hearted , madam , '' he say ; but he do not wish for a second bath . `` I have never think about my heart , '' continue the Portuguese duck , `` but I know this much , that I love all my fellow-creatures except the cat ; but nobody can expect I to love she , for she eat up two of my duckling . but pray make yourself at home , for one can make oneself comfortable . I myself be from a strange country , as you may see from my bearing , and from my feathery dress . my drake be a native of these part , he be not of my race ; but for all that I be not proud ! if any one here in the yard can understand you , I may assert that I be that person . '' `` she be quite full of Portulak , '' say a little common duck , who be witty ; and all the other common duck consider the word _ Portulak _ quite a good joke , for it sound like Portugal ; and they nudge each other and say `` Rapp ! '' it be too witty ! and all the other duck now begin to notice the little singing bird . `` the Portuguese have certainly a greater command of language , '' they say . `` for we part , we do not care to fill we beak with such long word , but we sympathy be just as great . if we do not do anything for you , we march about with you everywhere ; and we think that the best thing we can do . '' `` you have a lovely voice , '' say one of the oldest . `` it must be a great satisfaction to be able to give so much pleasure as you be able to impart . I certainly be no great judge of you song , and consequently I keep my beak shut ; and even that be better than talk nonsense to you , as other do . '' `` do not plague he so , '' interpose the Portuguese duck : `` he require rest and nursing . my little singing bird , do you wish I to prepare another bath for you ? '' `` oh no ! pray let I be dry ! '' be the little bird 's petition . `` the water-cure be the only remedy for I when I be unwell , '' quoth the Portuguese . `` amusement be beneficial too ! the neighbour fowl will soon come to pay they visit . there be two Cochin Chinese among they . they wear feather on they leg , be well educate , and have be bring from afar , consequently they stand higher than the other in my regard . '' and the fowl come , and the cock come ; to-day he be polite enough to abstain from be rude . `` you be a true singing bird , '' he say , `` and you do as much with you little voice as can possibly be do with it . but one require a little more shrillness , that every hearer may hear that one be a male . '' the two Chinese stand quite enchant with the appearance of the singing bird . he look very much rumpled after he bath , so that he seem to they to have quite the appearance of a little Cochin China fowl . `` he be charming , '' they cry , and begin a conversation with he , speak in whisper , and use the most aristocratic chinese dialect . -lrb-B- illustration : the little singing bird receive distinguished patronage . aaaaa -rrb-B- aaa `` we be of you race , '' they continue . `` the duck , even the Portuguese , be swim bird , as you can not fail to have notice . you do not know we yet ; very few know we , or give themselves the trouble to make we acquaintance -- not even any of the fowl , though we be bear to occupy a higher grade on the ladder than most of the rest . but that do not disturb we : we quietly pursue we path amid the other , whose principle be certainly not ours ; for we look at thing on the favourable side , and only speak of what be good , though it be difficult sometimes to find something when nothing exist . except we two and the cock , there be no one in the whole poultry-yard who be at once talented and polite . it can not even be say of the inhabitant of the duck-yard . we warn you , little singing bird : do not trust that one yonder with the short tail feather , for she be cunning . the pie one there , with the crooked stripe on she wing , be a strife-seeker , and let nobody have the last word , though she be always in the wrong . the fat duck yonder speak evil of every one , and that be against we principle : if we have nothing good to tell , we should hold we beak . the Portuguese be the only one who have any education , and with whom one can associate , but she be passionate , and talk too much about Portugal . '' `` I wonder what those two chinese be always whisper to one another about , '' whisper one duck to she friend . `` they annoy I -- we have never speak to they . '' now the drake come up . he think the little singing bird be a sparrow . `` well , I do not understand the difference , '' he say ; `` and indeed it be all the same thing . he be only a plaything , and if one have they , why , one have they . '' `` do not attach any value to what he say , '' the Portuguese whisper . `` he be very respectable in business matter ; and with he business take precedence of everything . but now I shall lie down for a rest . one owe that to oneself , that one may be nice and fat when one be to be embalm with apple and plum . '' and accordingly she lay down in the sun , and wink with one eye ; and she lay very comfortably , and she feel very comfortable , and she sleep very comfortably . the little singing bird busy himself with he broken wing . at last he lay down too , and press close to he protectress : the sun shone warm and bright , and he have find a very good place . but the neighbour 's fowl be awake . they go about scratch up the earth ; and , to tell the truth , they have pay the visit simply and solely to find food for themselves . the chinese be the first to leave the duck-yard ; and the other fowl soon follow they . the witty little duck say of the Portuguese that the old lady be become a ducky dotard . at this the other duck laugh and cackle aloud . `` Ducky dotard , '' they whisper ; `` that be too witty ! '' and then they repeat the former joke about Portulak , and declare that it be vastly amusing . and then they lay down . they have be lie asleep for some time , when suddenly something be throw into the yard for they to eat . it come down with such a thwack , that the whole company start up from sleep and clap they wing . the Portuguese awake too , and throw herself over on the other side , press the little singing bird very hard as she do so . `` piep ! '' he cry ; `` you tread very hard upon I , madam . '' `` well , why do you lie in my way ? '' the duck retort . `` you must not be so touchy . I have nerve of my own , but yet I never call out ` piep ! ' `` do not be angry , '' say the little bird `` the ` piep ' come out of my beak unaware . '' the Portuguese do not listen to he , but begin eat as fast as she could , and make a good meal . when this be end , and she lay down again , the little bird come up , and want to be amiable , and sing : `` tillee-lilly lee , of the good spring time , I 'll sing so fine as far away I flee . '' `` now I want to rest after my dinner , '' say the Portuguese . `` you must conform to the rule of the house while you be here . I want to sleep now . '' the little singing bird be quite take aback , for he have mean it kindly . when Madam afterwards awake , he stand before she again with a little corn that he have find , and lay it at she foot ; but as she have not sleep well , she be naturally in a very bad humor . `` give that to a chicken ! '' she say , `` and do not be always stand in my way . '' `` why be you angry with I ? '' reply the little singing bird . `` what have I do ? '' `` done ! '' repeat the Portuguese duck : `` you mode of expression be not exactly genteel ; a fact to which I must call you attention . '' `` yesterday it be sunshine here , '' say the little bird , `` but to-day it be cloudy and the air be close . '' `` you do not know much about the weather , I fancy , '' retort the Portuguese . `` the day be not do yet . do not stand there look so stupid . '' `` but you be look at I just as the wicked eye look when I fall into the yard yesterday . '' `` impertinent creature ! '' exclaim the Portuguese duck , `` would you compare I with the cat , that beast of prey ? there be not a drop of malicious blood in I . I have take you part , and will teach you good manners . '' and so say , she bit off the singing bird 's head , and he lay dead on the ground . `` now , what be the meaning of this ? '' she say , `` could he not bear even that ? then certainly he be not make for this world . I have be like a mother to he I know that , for I have a good heart . '' then the neighbour 's cock stick he head into the yard , and crow with steam-engine power . `` you 'll kill I with you crowing ! '' she cry . `` it be all you fault . he be lose he head , and I be very near losing mine . '' `` there be not much lie where he fall ! '' observe the cock . `` speak of he with respect , '' retort the Portuguese duck , `` for he have song , manners , and education . he be affectionate and soft , and that be as good in animal , as in you so-called human being . '' and all the duck come crowd round the little dead singing bird . duck have strong passion , whether they feel envy or pity ; and as there be nothing here to envy , pity manifest itself , even in the two chinese . `` we shall never get such a singing bird again ; he be almost a chinese , '' they whisper , and they weep with a mighty clucking sound , and all the fowl cluck too ; but the duck go about with the redder eye . `` we have heart of we own , '' they say ; `` nobody can deny that . '' `` HeartsS ! '' repeat the Portuguese , `` yes , that we have , almost as much as in Portugal . '' `` let we think of get something to satisfy we hunger , '' say the drake , `` for that be the most important point . if one of we toy be break , why , we have plenty more ! ''
