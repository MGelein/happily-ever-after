'' then the youth go to the gallows , sit down below it , and wait till evening come . and as he be cold , he light himself a fire , but at midnight the wind blow so sharply that in spite of he fire , he could not get warm . and as the wind knock the hang man against each other , and they move backwards and forwards , he think to himself `` Thou shiverest below by the fire , but how those up above must freeze and suffer ! '' and as he feel pity for they , he raise the ladder , and climb up , unbound one of they after the other , and bring down all seven . then he stir the fire , blow it , and set they all round it to warm themselves . but they sit there and do not stir , and the fire catch they clothes . so he say , `` take care , or I will hang you up again . '' the dead man , however , do not hear , but be quite silent , and let they rag go on burning . on this he grow angry , and say , `` if you will not take care , I can not help you , I will not be burn with you , '' and he hang they up again each in he turn . then he sit down by he fire and fall asleep , and the next morning the man come to he and want to have the fifty thaler , and say , `` well , dost thou know how to shudder ? '' `` no , '' answer he , `` how be I to get to know ? those fellow up there do not open they mouth , and be so stupid that they let the few old rag which they have on they body get burnt . '' then the man see that he would not get the fifty thaler that day , and go away say , `` one of this kind have never come my way before . '' the youth likewise go he way , and once more begin to mutter to himself , `` ah , if I could but shudder ! ah , if I could but shudder ! '' a waggoner who be stride behind he hear that and ask , `` who be you ? '' `` I do not know , '' answer the youth . then the waggoner ask , `` from whence comest thou ? '' `` I know not . '' `` who be thy father ? '' `` that I may not tell thee . '' `` what be it that thou art always mutter between thy tooth . '' `` ah , '' reply the youth , `` I do so wish I could shudder , but no one can teach I how to do it . '' `` give up thy foolish chatter , '' say the waggoner . `` come , go with I , I will see about a place for thee . '' the youth go with the waggoner , and in the evening they arrive at a inn where they wish to pass the night . then at the entrance of the room the youth again say quite loudly , `` if I could but shudder ! if I could but shudder ! '' the host who hear this , laugh and say , `` if that be you desire , there ought to be a good opportunity for you here . '' `` ah , be silent , '' say the hostess , `` so many inquisitive person have already lose they life , it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eye as these should never see the daylight again . '' but the youth say , `` however difficult it may be , I will learn it and for this purpose indeed have I journey forth . '' he let the host have no rest , until the latter tell he , that not far from thence stand a haunt castle where any one could very easily learn what shuddering be , if he would but watch in it for three night . the King have promise that he who would venture should have he daughter to wife , and she be the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on . great treasure likewise lay in the castle , which be guard by evil spirit , and these treasure would then be free , and would make a poor man rich enough . already many man have go into the castle , but as yet none have come out again . then the youth go next morning to the King and say if he be allow he would watch three night in the haunt castle . the King look at he , and as the youth please he , he say , `` Thou mayest ask for three thing to take into the castle with thee , but they must be thing without life . '' then he answer , `` then I ask for a fire , a turn lathe , and a cutting-board with the knife . '' the King have these thing carry into the castle for he during the day . when night be draw near , the youth go up and make himself a bright fire in one of the room , place the cutting-board and knife beside it , and seat himself by the turning-lathe . `` ah , if I could but shudder ! '' say he , `` but I shall not learn it here either . '' towards midnight he be about to poke he fire , and as he be blow it , something cry suddenly from one corner , `` Au , miau ! how cold we be ! '' `` you simpleton ! '' cry he , `` what be you cry about ? if you be cold , come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselve . '' and when he have say that , two great black cat come with one tremendous leap and sit down on each side of he , and look savagely at he with they fiery eye . after a short time , when they have warm themselves , they say , `` comrade , shall we have a game at card ? '' `` why not ? '' he reply , `` but just show I you paw . '' then they stretch out they claw . `` oh , '' say he , `` what long nail you have ! wait , I must first cut they for you . '' Thereupon he seize they by the throat , put they on the cutting-board and screw they foot fast . `` I have look at you finger , '' say he , `` and my fancy for card-playing have go , '' and he strike they dead and throw they out into the water . but when he have make away with these two , and be about to sit down again by he fire , out from every hole and corner come black cat and black dog with red-hot chain , and more and more of they come until he could no longer stir , and they yell horribly , and get on he fire , pull it to piece , and try to put it out . he watch they for a while quietly , but at last when they be go too far , he seize he cutting-knife , and cry , `` away with ye , vermin , '' and begin to cut they down . part of they run away , the other he kill , and throw out into the fish-pond . when he come back he fan the ember of he fire again and warm himself . and as he thus sit , he eye would keep open no longer , and he feel a desire to sleep . then he look round and see a great bed in the corner . `` that be the very thing for I , '' say he , and get into it . when he be just go to shut he eye , however , the bed begin to move of its own accord , and go over the whole of the castle . `` that be right , '' say he , `` but go faster . '' then the bed roll on as if six horse be harness to it , up and down , over threshold and step , but suddenly hop , hop , it turn over upside down , and lay on he like a mountain . but he throw quilt and pillow up in the air , get out and say , `` now any one who like , may drive , '' and lay down by he fire , and sleep till it be day . in the morning the King come , and when he see he lie there on the ground , he think the evil spirit have kill he and he be dead . then say he , `` after all it be a pity , -- he be a handsome man . '' the youth hear it , get up , and say , `` it have not come to that yet . '' then the King be astonish , but very glad , and ask how he have fare . `` very well indeed , '' answer he ; `` one night be past , the two other will get over likewise . '' then he go to the innkeeper , who open he eye very wide , and say , `` I never expect to see thee alive again ! Hast thou learn how to shudder yet ? '' `` no , '' say he , `` it be all in vain . if some one would but tell I . '' the second night he again go up into the old castle , sit down by the fire , and once more begin he old song , `` if I could but shudder . '' when midnight come , a uproar and noise of tumble about be hear ; at first it be low , but it grow louder and louder . then it be quiet for awhile , and at length with a loud scream , half a man come down the chimney and fall before he . `` Hollo ! '' cry he , `` another half belong to this . this be too little ! '' then the uproar begin again , there be a roaring and howling , and the other half fall down likewise . `` wait , '' say he , `` I will just blow up the fire a little for thee . '' when he have do that and look round again , the two piece be join together , and a frightful man be sit in he place . `` that be no part of we bargain , '' say the youth , `` the bench be mine . '' the man want to push he away ; the youth , however , would not allow that , but thrust he off with all he strength , and seat himself again in he own place . then still more man fall down , one after the other ; they bring nine dead man 's leg and two skull , and set they up and play at nine-pins with they . the youth also want to play and say `` Hark you , can I join you ? '' `` yes , if thou hast any money . '' `` money enough , '' reply he , `` but you ball be not quite round . '' then he take the skull and put they in the lathe and turn they till they be round . `` there , now , they will roll better ! '' say he . `` Hurrah ! now it go merrily ! '' he play with they and lose some of he money , but when it strike twelve , everything vanish from he sight . he lay down and quietly fall asleep . next morning the King come to inquire after he . `` how have it fare with you this time ? '' ask he . `` I have be play at nine-pins , '' he answer , `` and have lose a couple of farthing . '' `` hast thou not shudder then ? '' `` Eh , what ? '' say he , `` I have make merry . if I do but know what it be to shudder ! '' the third night he sit down again on he bench and say quite sadly , `` if I could but shudder . '' when it grow late , six tall man come in and bring a coffin . then say he , `` Ha , ha , that be certainly my little cousin , who die only a few day ago , '' and he beckon with he finger , and cry `` come , little cousin , come . '' they place the coffin on the ground , but he go to it and take the lid off , and a dead man lay therein . he feel he face , but it be cold as ice . `` stop , '' say he , `` I will warm thee a little , '' and go to the fire and warm he hand and lay it on the dead man 's face , but he remain cold . then he take he out , and sit down by the fire and lay he on he breast and rub he arm that the blood might circulate again . as this also do no good , he think to himself `` when two people lie in bed together , they warm each other , '' and carry he to the bed , cover he over and lay down by he . after a short time the dead man become warm too , and begin to move . then say the youth , `` See , little cousin , have I not warm thee ? '' the dead man , however , get up and cry , `` now will I strangle thee . '' `` what ! '' say he , `` be that the way thou thankest I ? Thou shalt at once go into thy coffin again , '' and he take he up , throw he into it , and shut the lid . then come the six man and carry he away again . `` I can not manage to shudder , '' say he . `` I shall never learn it here as long as I live . '' then a man enter who be taller than all other , and look terrible . he be old , however , and have a long white beard . `` Thou wretch , '' cry he , `` thou shalt soon learn what it be to shudder , for thou shalt die . '' `` not so fast , '' reply the youth . `` if I be to die , I shall have to have a say in it . '' `` I will soon seize thee , '' say the fiend . `` softly , softly , do not talk so big . I be as strong as thou art , and perhaps even stronger . '' `` we shall see , '' say the old man . `` if thou art stronger , I will let thee go -- come , we will try . '' then he lead he by dark passage to a smith 's forge , take a axe , and with one blow strike a anvil into the ground . `` I can do better than that , '' say the youth , and go to the other anvil . the old man place himself near and want to look on , and he white beard hang down . then the youth seize the axe , split the anvil with one blow , and strike the old man 's beard in with it . `` now I have thee , '' say the youth . `` now it be thou who will have to die . '' then he seize a iron bar and beat the old man till he moan and entreat he to stop , and he would give he great riches . the youth draw out the axe and let he go . the old man lead he back into the castle , and in a cellar show he three chest full of gold . `` of these , '' say he , `` one part be for the poor , the other for the king , the third be thine . '' in the meantime it strike twelve , and the spirit disappear ; the youth , therefore , be leave in darkness . `` I shall still be able to find my way out , '' say he , and feel about , find the way into the room , and sleep there by he fire . next morning the King come and say `` now thou must have learn what shuddering be ? '' `` no , '' he answer ; `` what can it be ? my dead cousin be here , and a bearded man come and show I a great deal of money down below , but no one tell I what it be to shudder . '' `` then , '' say the King , `` thou hast deliver the castle , and shalt marry my daughter . '' `` that be all very well , '' say he , `` but still I do not know what it be to shudder . '' then the gold be bring up and the wedding celebrate ; but howsoever much the young king love he wife , and however happy he be , he still say always `` if I could but shudder -- if I could but shudder . '' and at last she be angry at this . she waiting-maid say , `` I will find a cure for he ; he shall soon learn what it be to shudder . '' she go out to the stream which flow through the garden , and have a whole bucketful of gudgeon bring to she . at night when the young king be sleep , he wife be to draw the clothes off he and empty the bucketful of cold water with the gudgeon in it over he , so that the little fish would sprawl about he . when this be do , he wake up and cry `` oh , what make I shudder so ? -- what make I shudder so , dear wife ? ah ! now I know what it be to shudder !
