TWENTY-FIRST EVENING . H. C. Andersen `` I see a little girl weep , '' say the moon ; `` she be weep over the depravity of the world . she have receive a most beautiful doll as a present . oh , that be a glorious doll , so fair and delicate ! she do not seem create for the sorrow of this world . but the brother of the little girl , those great naughty boy , have set the doll high up in the branch of a tree , and have run away . `` the little girl could not reach up to the doll , and could not help she down , and that be why she be cry . the doll must certainly have be cry too ; for she stretch out she arm among the green branch , and look quite mournful . yes , these be the trouble of life of which the little girl have often hear tell . Alas , poor doll ! it begin to grow dark already ; and suppose night be to come on completely ! be she to be leave sit there alone on the bough all night long ? no , the little maid could not make up she mind to that . ` I 'll stay with you , ' she say , although she feel anything but happy in she mind . she could almost fancy she distinctly see little gnome , with they high-crowned hat , sit in the bush ; and further back in the long walk , tall spectre appear to be dance . they come nearer and nearer , and stretch out they hand towards the tree on which the doll sit ; they laugh scornfully , and point at she with they finger . oh , how frightened the little maid be ! ` but if one have not do anything wrong , ' she think , ` nothing evil can harm one . I wonder if I have do anything wrong ? ' and she consider . ` oh , yes ! I laugh at the poor duck with the red rag on she leg ; she limp along so funnily , I could not help laughing ; but it be a sin to laugh at animal . ' and she look up at the doll . ` do you laugh at the duck too ? ' she ask ; and it seem as if the doll shake she head . ''
