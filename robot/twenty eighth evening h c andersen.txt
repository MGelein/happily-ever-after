TWENTY-EIGHTH EVENING . H. C. Andersen `` I will give you another picture of Sweden , '' say the moon . `` among dark pine wood , near the melancholy bank of the Stoxen , lie the old convent church of Wreta . my ray glide through the grate into the roomy vault , where king sleep tranquilly in great stone coffin . on the wall , above the grave of each , be place the emblem of earthly grandeur , a kingly crown ; but it be make only of wood , paint and gilt , and be hang on a wooden peg drive into the wall . the worm have gnaw the gilded wood , the spider have spin she web from the crown down to the sand , like a mourn banner , frail and transient as the grief of mortal . how quietly they sleep ! I can remember they quite plainly . I still see the bold smile on they lip , that so strongly and plainly express joy or grief . when the steamboat wind along like a magic snail over the lake , a stranger often come to the church , and visit the burial vault ; he ask the name of the king , and they have a dead and forget sound . he glance with a smile at the worm-eaten crown , and if he happen to be a pious , thoughtful man , something of melancholy mingle with the smile . Slumber on , ye dead one ! the Moon think of you , the moon at night send down he ray into you silent kingdom , over which hang the crown of pine wood . ''
