THIRTY-FIRST EVENING . H. C. Andersen the wind blow stormy and cold , the cloud fly hurriedly past ; only for a moment now and then do the moon become visible . he say , `` I look down from the silent sky upon the drive cloud , and see the great shadow chase each other across the earth . I look upon a prison . a closed carriage stand before it ; a prisoner be to be carry away . my ray pierce through the grate window towards the wall : the prisoner be scratch a few line upon it , as a parting token ; but he do not write word , but a melody , the outpouring of he heart . the door be open , and he be lead forth , and fix he eye upon my round disc . cloud pass between we , as if he be not to see my face , nor I he . he step into the carriage , the door be close , the whip crack , and the horse gallop off into the thick forest , whither my ray be not able to follow he ; but as I glance through the grate window , my ray glide over the note , he last farewell engrave on the prison wall -- where word fail , sound can often speak . my ray could only light up isolated note , so the greater part of what be write there will ever remain dark to I . be it the death-hymn he write there ? be these the glad note of joy ? do he drive away to meet death , or hasten to the embrace of he beloved ? the ray of the Moon do not read all that be write by mortal .
