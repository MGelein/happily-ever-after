'' Jimmy Rabbit seem to be relieve to hear that . `` come on over and play , '' he say . `` my brother and I be play barber - shop over in the old sycamore tree ; and we need you . '' `` all right ! '' say Fatty . it be not often that any of the smaller forest-people be willing to play with he , because generally fatty could not help get hungry and then he usually try to eat he playmate . `` what do you need I for ? '' Fatty ask , as he trudge along beside Jimmy Rabbit . `` we need you for the barber 's pole , '' Jimmy explain . `` you can come inside the hollow tree and stick you tail out through a hole . it will make a fine barber 's pole -- though the stripe do run the wrong way , to be sure . '' Fatty Coon be greatly pleased . he look around at he tail and feel very proud . `` I have get a beautiful tail -- have not I ? '' he ask . `` um -- yes ! '' Jimmy Rabbit reply , `` though I must say it be not one that I would care for myself ... but come along ! there may be people wait to get they hair cut . '' sure enough ! when they reach the make-believe barber-shop there be a gray squirrel inside , and Jimmy Rabbit 's brother be busily snip the fur off Mr. Squirrel 's head . `` how much do you charge for a hair-cut ?

'' `` well , do not I get anything for the use of my tail ? '' Fatty ask . he have already stick it out through the hole ; and he have half a mind to pull it in again . Jimmy Rabbit and he brother whisper together for a few moment . `` I 'll tell you what we 'll do , '' Jimmy say . `` if you 'll let we use you tail for the barber 's pole , we 'll cut you hair free . be not that fair enough ? '' Fatty Coon be satisfy . but he insist that Jimmy begin to cut he hair at once . `` I be do my part of the work now , '' he point out . `` so there be no reason why you should not do yours . '' with that Jimmy Rabbit begin . he clip and snip at Fatty 's head , pause now and then to see the effect . he smile once in a while , behind Fatty 's back , because Fatty certainly do look funny with he fur all ragged and uneven . `` moustache trim ? '' Jimmy Rabbit ask , when he have finish with Fatty 's head . `` certainly -- of course ! '' Fatty Coon answer . and pretty soon Fatty 's long white moustache lay on the floor of the barber-shop . Fatty feel a bit uneasy as he look down and see he beautiful moustache lie at he foot . `` you have not cut it too short , I hope , '' he say . `` no , indeed ! '' Jimmy Rabbit assure he . `` it be the very latest style . '' `` what on earth have happen to you ? '' Mrs. Coon cry , -- when Fatty reach home that night . `` have you be in a fire ? '' `` it be the latest style , Mother , '' Fatty tell she . `` at least , that be what Jimmy Rabbit say . '' he feel the least bit uneasy again . `` do you let that Jimmy Rabbit do that to you ? '' Mrs. Coon ask . Fatty hang he head . he say nothing at all . but he mother know . `` well ! you be a sight ! '' she exclaim . `` it will be month before you look like my child again . I shall be ashamed to go anywhere with you . '' Fatty Coon feel very foolish . and there be just one thing that keep he from cry . and that be THIS : he make up he mind that when he play barber-shop with Jimmy Rabbit again he would get even with he . but when the next day come , Fatty could not find Jimmy Rabbit and he brother anywhere . they keep out of sight . but they have tell all the other forest-people about the trick they have play on Fatty Coon . and everywhere Fatty go he hear nothing but hoot and jeer and laugh . he feel very silly . and he wish that he might meet Jimmy Rabbit and he brother .
