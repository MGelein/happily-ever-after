the CRUEL CRANE OUTWITTED Indian Writer Long ago the Bodisat be bear to a forest life as the genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond . now at that time the water use to run short at the dry season in a certain pond , not over large , in which there be a good many fish . and a crane think on see the fish . `` I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of they . '' and he go and sit down at the edge of the water , think how he should do it . when the fish see he , they ask he , `` what be you sit there for , lose in thought ? '' `` I be sit think about you , '' say he . `` oh , sir ! what be you think about we ? '' say they . `` why , '' he reply ; `` there be very little water in this pond , and but little for you to eat ; and the heat be so great ! so I be think , ` what in the world will these fish do now ? ' '' `` yes , indeed , sir ! what _ be _ we to do ? '' say they . `` if you will only do as I bid you , I will take you in my beak to a fine large pond , cover with all the kind of lotus , and put you into it , '' answer the crane . `` that a crane should take thought for the fish be a thing unheard of , sir , since the world begin . it be eat we , one after the other , that you be aim at . '' `` not I ! so long as you trust I , I will not eat you . but if you do not believe I that there be such a pond , send one of you with I to go and see it . '' then they trust he , and hand over to he one of they number -- a big fellow , blind of one eye , whom they think sharp enough in any emergency , afloat or ashore . he the crane take with he , let he go in the pond , show he the whole of it , bring he back , and let he go again close to the other fish . and he tell they all the glory of the pond . and when they hear what he say , they exclaim , `` all right , sir ! you may take we with you . '' then the crane take the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond , and alight in a varana-tree grow on the bank there . but he throw it into a fork of the tree , strike it with he beak , and kill it ; and then eat its flesh , and throw its bone away at the foot of the tree . then he go back and call out : `` I have throw that fish in ; let another one come . '' and in that manner he take all the fish , one by one , and eat they , till he come back and find no more ! but there be still a crab leave behind there ; and the crane think he would eat he too , and call out : `` I say , good crab , I have take all the fish away , and put they into a fine large pond . come along . I 'll take you too ! '' `` but how will you take hold of I to carry I along ? '' `` I 'll bite hold of you with my beak . '' `` you 'll let I fall if you carry I like that . I will not go with you ! '' `` do not be afraid ! I 'll hold you quite tight all the way . '' then say the crab to himself , `` if this fellow once get hold of fish , he would never let they go in a pond ! now if he should really put I into the pond , it would be capital ; but if he do not -- then I 'll cut he throat , and kill he ! '' so he say to he : `` look here , friend , you will not be able to hold I tight enough ; but we crab have a famous grip . if you let I catch hold of you round the neck with my claw , I shall be glad to go with you . '' and the other do not see that he be try to outwit he , and agree . so the crab catch hold of he neck with he claw as securely as with a pair of blacksmith 's pincers , and call out , `` off with you , now ! '' and the crane take he and show he the pond , and then turn off towards the varana-tree . `` Uncle ! '' cry the crab , `` the pond lie that way , but you be take I this way ! '' `` oh , that be it , be it ? '' answer the crane . `` you dear little uncle , you very sweet nephew , you call I ! you mean I to understand , I suppose , that I be you slave , who have to lift you up and carry you about with he ! now cast you eye upon the heap of fish-bones lie at the root of yonder varana-tree . just as I have eat those fish , every one of they , just so I will devour you as well ! '' `` ah ! those fish get eat through they own stupidity , '' answer the crab ; `` but I be not go to let you eat _ I _ . on the contrary , be it _ you _ that I be go to destroy . for you in you folly have not see that I be outwit you . if we die , we die both together ; for I will cut off this head of yours , and cast it to the ground ! '' and so say , he give the crane 's neck a grip with he claw , as with a vice . then gasp , and with tear trickle from he eye , and tremble with the fear of death , the crane beseech he , say , `` O my Lord ! indeed I do not intend to eat you . Grant I my life ! '' `` well , well ! step down into the pond , and put I in there . '' and he turn round and step down into the pond , and place the crab on the mud at its edge . but the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife , and then only enter the water ! when the genius who live in the varana-tree saw this strange affair , he make the wood resound with he plaudit , utter in a pleasant voice the verse : `` the villain , though exceed clever , Shall prosper not by he villainy . he may win indeed , sharp-witted in deceit , but only as the Crane here from the crab !
