the BROKEN POT Indian Writer there live in a certain place a Brahman , whose name be Svabhavak_ri_pa_n_a , which mean `` a bear miser . '' he have collect a quantity of rice by beg , and after have dine off it , he fill a pot with what be leave over . he hang the pot on a peg on the wall , place he couch beneath , and look intently at it all the night , he think , `` ah , that pot be indeed brimful of rice . now , if there should be a famine , I should certainly make a hundred rupee by it . with this I shall buy a couple of goat . they will have young one every six month , and thus I shall have a whole herd of goat . then , with the goat , I shall buy cow . as soon as they have calve , I shall sell the calf . then , with the calf , I shall buy buffalo ; with the buffalo , mare . when the mare have foal , I shall have plenty of horse ; and when I sell they , plenty of gold . with that gold I shall get a house with four wing . and then a Brahman will come to my house , and will give I he beautiful daughter , with a large dowry . she will have a son , and I shall call he Somasarman . when he be old enough to be dance on he father 's knee , I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable , and while I be reading , the boy will see I , jump from he mother 's lap , and run towards I to be dance on my knee . he will come too near the horse 's hoof , and , full of anger , I shall call to my wife , ` take the baby ; take he ! ' but she , distract by some domestic work , do not hear I . then I get up , and give she such a kick with my foot . '' while he think this , he give a kick with he foot , and break the pot . all the rice fall over he , and make he quite white . therefore , I say , `` he who make foolish plan for the future will be white all over , like the father of Somasarman .
