MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE be Beatrix Potter nose go sniffle , sniffle , snuffle , and she eye go twinkle , twinkle ; and she fetch another hot iron from the fire . `` THERE be one of my pocket-handkins ! '' cried Lucie -- `` and there be my pinny ! '' Mrs. Tiggy-winkle iron it , and goffer it , and shake out the frill . `` oh that be lovely ! '' say Lucie . `` and what be those long yellow thing with finger like glove ? '' `` oh , that be a pair of stocking belong to Sally Henny - penny -- look how she be worn the heel out with scratch in the yard ! she 'll very soon go barefoot ! '' say Mrs. Tiggy - winkle . `` why , there be another handkersniff -- but it be not mine ; it be red ? '' `` oh no , if you please be ; that one belong to old Mrs. Rabbit ; and it do so smell of onion ! I have have to wash it separately , I can not get out the smell . '' `` there be another one of mine , '' say Lucie . `` what be those funny little white thing ? '' `` that be a pair of mitten belong to Tabby Kitten ; I only have to iron they ; she wash they herself . '' `` there be my last pocket - handkin ! '' say Lucie . `` and what be you dip into the basin of starch ? '' `` they be little dicky shirt - front belong to Tom Titmouse -- most terrible particular !

'' ask Lucy . `` oh yes , if you please be ; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder . and here 's one marked for Gatesgarth , and three that come from little-town . they be always mark at wash ! '' say Mrs. Tiggy - winkle . and she hang up all sort and size of clothes -- small brown coat of mouse ; and one velvety black mole - skin waist-coat ; and a red tail - coat with no tail belong to Squirrel Nutkin ; and a very much shrink blue jacket belong to Peter Rabbit ; and a petticoat , not mark , that have go lose in the wash -- and at last the basket be empty ! THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle make tea -- a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie . they sit before the fire on a bench and look sideways at one another . Mrs. Tiggy-winkle 's hand , hold the tea-cup , be very very brown , and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds ; and all through she gown and she cap , there be hair-pins sticking wrong end out ; so that Lucie do not like to sit too near she . when they have finish tea , they tie up the clothes in bundle ; and Lucie 's pocket-handkerchiefs be fold up inside she clean pinny , and fasten with a silver safety-pin . and then they make up the fire with turf , and come out and lock the door , and hide the key under the door-sill . then away down the hill trot Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundle of clothes ! all the way down the path little animal come out of the fern to meet they ; the very first that they meet be Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny ! and she give they they nice clean clothes ; and all the little animal and bird be so very much oblige to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle . so that at the bottom of the hill when they come to the stile , there be nothing leave to carry except Lucie 's one little bundle . LUCIE scramble up the stile with the bundle in she hand ; and then she turn to say `` good-night , '' and to thank the washer-woman -- but what a VERY odd thing ! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle have not wait either for thanks or for the wash bill ! she be run run run up the hill -- and where be she white frilled cap ? and she shawl ? and she gown -- and she petticoat ? and how small she have grow -- and how brown -- and cover with PRICKLES ! why ! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle be nothing but a HEDGEHOG . -lrb-B- now some people say that little Lucie have be asleep upon the stile -- but then how could she have find three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny , pin with a silver safety-pin ? and besides -- _ I _ have see that door into the back of the hill call Cat BellsS -- and besides _ I _ be very well acquaint with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ! -rrb-B-
