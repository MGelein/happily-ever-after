'' ' _ ting-ting ! _ ' and the little iron chandelier suddenly rise at least half a yard and disappear in the tub ; and that be the sign that the play be go to begin . a young nobleman and he lady , who happen to be pass through the little town , be present at the performance , and consequently the house be crowd . but under the chandelier be a vacant space like a little crater : not a single soul sit there , for the tallow be drop , drip , drip ! I see everything , for it be so warm in there that every loophole have be open . the male and female servant stand outside , peep through the chink , although a real policeman be inside , threaten they with a stick . close by the orchestra could be see the noble young couple in two old arm-chairs , which be usually occupy by he worship the mayor and he lady ; but these latter be to-day oblige to content themselves with wooden form , just as if they have be ordinary citizen ; and the lady observe quietly to herself , ` one see , now , that there be rank above rank ; ' and this incident give a air of extra festivity to the whole proceedings . the chandelier give little leap , the crowd get they knuckle rap , and I , the Moon , be present at the performance from begin to end .
