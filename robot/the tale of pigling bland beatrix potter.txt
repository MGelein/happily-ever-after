the tale of PIGLING BLAND Beatrix Potter once upon a time there be a old pig call Aunt Pettitoes . she have eight of a family : four little girl pig , call Cross-patch , suck-suck , yock-yock and spot ; and four little boy pig , call Alexander , Pigling Bland , Chin - chin and Stumpy . Stumpy have have a accident to he tail . the eight little pig have very fine appetite . `` Yus , yus , yus ! they eat and indeed they do eat ! '' say Aunt Pettitoes , look at she family with pride . suddenly there be fearful squeal ; Alexander have squeeze inside the hoop of the pig trough and stick . Aunt Pettitoes and I drag he out by the hind leg . chin-chin be already in disgrace ; it be wash day , and he have eat a piece of soap . and presently in a basket of clean clothes , we find another dirty little pig . `` Tchut , tut , tut ! whichever be this ? '' grunted Aunt Pettitoes . now all the pig family be pink , or pink with black spot , but this pig child be smutty black all over ; when it have be pop into a tub , it prove to be yock-yock . I go into the garden ; there I find cross-patch and suck-suck root up carrot . I whip they myself and lead they out by the ear . cross-patch try to bite I . `` Aunt Pettitoes , Aunt Pettitoes ! you be a worthy person , but you family be not well bring up . every one of they have be in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland . '' `` Yus , yus ! '' sigh Aunt Pettitoes . `` and they drink bucketful of milk ; I shall have to get another cow ! good little spot shall stay at home to do the housework ; but the other must go . four little boy pig and four little girl pig be too many altogether . '' `` Yus , yus , yus , '' say Aunt Pettitoes , `` there will be more to eat without they . '' so chin-chin and suck-suck go away in a wheel-barrow , and Stumpy , Yock-yock and Cross - patch ride away in a cart . and the other two little boy pig , Pigling Bland and Alexander , go to market . we brush they coat , we curl they tail and wash they little face , and wish they good-bye in the yard . Aunt Pettitoes wipe she eye with a large pocket handkerchief , then she wipe Pigling Bland 's nose and shed tear ; then she wipe Alexander 's nose and shed tear ; then she pass the handkerchief to Spot . Aunt Pettitoes sigh and grunt , and address those little pig as follow : `` now pigle Bland , son Pigling Bland , you must go to market . take you brother Alexander by the hand . mind you Sunday clothes , and remember to blow you nose '' -- -lrb-B- Aunt Pettitoes pass round the handkerchief again -rrb-B- -- `` beware of trap , hen roost , bacon and egg ; always walk upon you hind leg . '' pigle Bland , who be a sedate little pig , look solemnly at he mother , a tear trickle down he cheek . Aunt Pettitoes turn to the other -- `` now son Alexander take the hand '' -- `` Wee , wee , wee ! '' giggle Alexander -- `` take the hand of you brother Pigling Bland , you must go to market . mind -- '' `` Wee , wee , wee ! '' interrupted Alexander again . `` you put I out , '' say Aunt Pettitoes . `` Observe sign-posts and milestone ; do not gobble herr bone -- '' `` and remember , '' say I impressively , `` if you once cross the county boundary you can not come back . Alexander , you be not attend . here be two licence permit two pig to go to market in Lancashire . attend , Alexander . I have have no end of trouble in get these papers from the policeman . '' pigle Bland listen gravely ; Alexander be hopelessly volatile . I pin the papers , for safety , inside they waistcoat pocket ; Aunt Pettitoes give to each a little bundle , and eight conversation peppermint with appropriate moral sentiment in screw of paper . then they start . pigle Bland and Alexander trot along steadily for a mile ; at least Pigling Bland do . Alexander make the road half as long again by skip from side to side . he dance about and pinch he brother , sing -- `` this pig go to market , this pig stay at home , `` this pig have a bit of meat -- let 's see what they have give US for dinner , pigle ? '' pigle Bland and Alexander sit down and untie they bundle . Alexander gobble up he dinner in no time ; he have already eat all he own peppermint . `` give I one of yours , please , Pigling . '' `` but I wish to preserve they for emergency , '' say Pigling Bland doubtfully . Alexander go into squeal of laughter . then he prick pigle with the pin that have fasten he pig paper ; and when pigle slap he he drop the pin , and try to take Pigling 's pin , and the papers get mix up . pigle Bland reprove Alexander . but presently they make it up again , and trot away together , sing -- `` Tom , Tom , the piper 's son , steal a pig and away he run ! `` but all the tune that he could play , be ` over the hill and far away ! ' '' `` what be that , young sir ? Stole a pig ? where be you licence ? '' say the policeman . they have nearly run against he round a corner . pigle Bland pull out he paper ; Alexander , after fumble , hand over something scrumply -- `` to 2 1\ oz . conversation sweetie at three farthing '' -- `` what be this ? this be not a licence . '' Alexander 's nose lengthen visibly , he have lose it . `` I have one , indeed I have , Mr. Policeman ! '' `` it be not likely they let you start without . I be pass the farm . you may walk with I . '' `` can I come back too ? '' inquire Pigling Bland . `` I see no reason , young sir ; you paper be all right . '' pigle Bland do not like go on alone , and it be begin to rain . but it be unwise to argue with the police ; he give he brother a peppermint , and watch he out of sight . to conclude the adventure of Alexander -- the policeman saunter up to the house about tea time , follow by a damp subdue little pig . I dispose of Alexander in the neighborhood ; he do fairly well when he have settle down . pigle Bland go on alone dejectedly ; he come to cross-roads and a sign-post -- `` to Market Town , 5 mile , '' `` over the Hills , 4 mile , '' `` to Pettitoes Farm , 3 mile . '' pigle Bland be shock , there be little hope of sleep in Market Town , and to-morrow be the hiring fair ; it be deplorable to think how much time have be waste by the frivolity of Alexander . he glance wistfully along the road towards the hill , and then set off walk obediently the other way , button up he coat against the rain . he have never want to go ; and the idea of stand all by himself in a crowded market , to be stare at , push , and hire by some big strange farmer be very disagreeable -- `` I wish I could have a little garden and grow potato , '' say Pigling Bland . he put he cold hand in he pocket and feel he paper , he put he other hand in he other pocket and feel another paper -- Alexander 's ! pigle squeal ; then run back frantically , hope to overtake Alexander and the policeman . he take a wrong turn -- several wrong turn , and be quite lose . it grow dark , the wind whistle , the tree creak and groan . pigle Bland become frightened and cried `` Wee , wee , wee ! I can not find my way home ! '' after a hour 's wander he get out of the wood ; the moon shone through the cloud , and Pigling Bland see a country that be new to he . the road cross a moor ; below be a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight , and beyond , in misty distance , lay the hill . he see a small wooden hut , make he way to it , and creep inside -- `` I be afraid it be a hen house , but what can I do ? '' say Pigling Bland , wet and cold and quite tire out . `` Bacon and egg , bacon and egg ! '' cluck a hen on a perch . `` trap , trap , trap ! cackle , cackle , cackle ! '' scold the disturbed cockerel . `` to market , to market ! jiggetty jig ! '' cluck a broody white hen roost next to he . pigle Bland , much alarm , determine to leave at daybreak . in the meantime , he and the hen fall asleep . in less than a hour they be all awaken . the owner , Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson , come with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowl to take to market in the morning . he grab the white hen roost next to the cock ; then he eye fall upon Pigling Bland , squeeze up in a corner . he make a singular remark -- `` Hallo , here 's another ! '' -- seize Pigling by the scruff of the neck , and drop he into the hamper . then he drop in five more dirty , kick , cackle hen upon the top of Pigling Bland . the hamper contain six fowl and a young pig be no light weight ; it be take down hill , unsteadily , with jerk . Pigling , although nearly scratch to piece , contrived to hide the papers and peppermint inside he clothes . at last the hamper be bump down upon a kitchen floor , the lid be open , and Pigling be lift out . he look up , blinking , and see a offensively ugly elderly man , grin from ear to ear . `` this one 's come of himself , whatever , '' say Mr. Piperson , turn Pigling 's pocket inside out . he push the hamper into a corner , throw a sack over it to keep the hen quiet , put a pot on the fire , and unlace he boot . Pigling Bland draw forward a coppy stool , and sit on the edge of it , shyly warm he hand . Mr. Piperson pull off a boot and throw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen . there be a smother noise -- `` shut up ! '' say Mr. Piperson . pigle Bland warm he hand , and eye he . Mr. Piperson pull off the other boot and flung it after the first , there be again a curious noise -- `` be quiet , will ye ? '' say Mr. Piperson . pigle Bland sit on the very edge of the coppy stool . Mr. Piperson fetch meal from a chest and make porridge . it seem to pigle that something at the further end of the kitchen be take a suppress interest in the cooking , but he be too hungry to be trouble by noise . Mr. Piperson pour out three plateful : for himself , for Pigling , and a third -- after glare at Pigling -- he put away with much scuffling , and lock up . Pigling Bland eat he supper discreetly . after supper Mr. Piperson consult a almanac , and feel Pigling 's rib ; it be too late in the season for cure bacon , and he grudge he meal . besides , the hen have see this pig . he look at the small remains of a flitch , and then look undecidedly at Pigling . `` you may sleep on the rug , '' say Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson . pigle Bland sleep like a top . in the morning Mr. Piperson make more porridge ; the weather be warmer . he look to see how much meal be leave in the chest , and seem dissatisfied -- `` you 'll likely be move on again ? '' say he to Pigling Bland . before pigle could reply , a neighbor , who be give Mr. Piperson and the hen a lift , whistle from the gate . Mr. Piperson hurry out with the hamper , enjoin Pigling to shut the door behind he and not meddle with nought ; or `` I 'll come back and skin ye ! '' say Mr. Piperson . it cross Pigling 's mind that if he have ask for a lift , too , he might still have be in time for market . but he distrust Peter Thomas . after finish breakfast at he leisure , Pigling have a look round the cottage ; everything be lock up . he find some potato peeling in a bucket in the back kitchen . Pigling eat the peel , and wash up the porridge plate in the bucket . he sing while he work -- `` Tom with he pipe make such a noise , he call up all the girl and boy -- `` and they all run to hear he play '' ` over the hill and far away ! ' '' suddenly a little smother voice chime in -- `` over the hill and a great way off , the wind shall blow my top knot off ! '' pigle Bland put down a plate which he be wipe , and listen . after a long pause , Pigling go on tip-toe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen . there be nobody there . after another pause , Pigling approach the door of the lock cupboard , and snuff at the key - hole . it be quite quiet . after another long pause , Pigling push a peppermint under the door . it be suck in immediately . in the course of the day pigle push in all the remain six peppermint . when Mr. Piperson return , he find pigle sit before the fire ; he have brush up the hearth and put on the pot to boil ; the meal be not get-at-able . Mr. Piperson be very affable ; he slap pigle on the back , make lot of porridge and forget to lock the meal chest . he do lock the cupboard door ; but without properly shut it . he go to bed early , and tell Pigling upon no account to disturb he next day before twelve o'clock . Pigling Bland sit by the fire , eat he supper . all at once at he elbow , a little voice speak -- `` my name be pig - wig . Make I more porridge , please ! '' Pigling Bland jump , and look round . a perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stand smile beside he . she have twinkly little screw up eye , a double chin , and a short turn up nose . she point at Pigling 's plate ; he hastily give it to she , and flee to the meal chest . `` how do you come here ? '' ask Pigling Bland . `` Stolen , '' reply Pig-wig , with she mouth full . pigle help himself to meal without scruple . `` what for ? '' `` Bacon , ham , '' reply Pig-wig cheerfully . `` why on earth do not you run away ? '' exclaim the horrified pigling . `` I shall after supper , '' say Pig - wig decidedly . pigle Bland make more porridge and watch she shyly . she finish a second plate , get up , and look about she , as though she be go to start . `` you can not go in the dark , '' say Pigling Bland . pig-wig look anxious . `` do you know you way by daylight ? '' `` I know we can see this little white house from the hill across the river . which way be you go , Mr. Pig ? '' `` to market -- I have two pig papers . I might take you to the bridge ; if you have no objection , '' say Pigling much confuse and sit on the edge of he coppy stool . pig-wig 's gratitude be such and she ask so many question that it become embarrassing to Pigling Bland . he be oblige to shut he eye and pretend to sleep . she become quiet , and there be a smell of peppermint . `` I think you have eat they , '' say Pigling , wake suddenly . `` only the corner , '' reply Pig - wig , study the sentiment with much interest by the firelight . `` I wish you would not ; he might smell they through the ceiling , '' say the alarmed pigling . pig-wig put back the sticky peppermint into she pocket ; `` sing something , '' she demand . `` I be sorry ... I have tooth - ache , '' say Pigling much dismay . `` then I will sing , '' reply Pig-wig . `` you will not mind if I say iddy tidditty ? I have forget some of the word . '' pigle Bland make no objection ; he sit with he eye half shut , and watch she . she wag she head and rock about , clap time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice -- `` a funny old mother pig live in a stye , and three little piggy have she ; '' -lrb-B- Ti idditty idditty -rrb-B- umph , umph , umph ! and the little pig say , wee , wee ! '' she sing successfully through three or four verse , only at every verse she head nod a little lower , and she little twinkly eye close up . `` those three little piggy grow peaky and lean , and lean they might very well be ; `` for somehow they could not say umph , umph , umph ! and they would not say wee , wee , wee ! `` for somehow they could not say -- pig-wig 's head bob lower and lower , until she roll over , a little round ball , fast asleep on the hearth-rug . pigle Bland , on tip-toe , cover she up with a antimacassar . he be afraid to go to sleep himself ; for the rest of the night he sit listen to the chirping of the cricket and to the snore of Mr. Piperson overhead . early in the morning , between dark and daylight , pigle tie up he little bundle and wake up pig - wig . she be excite and half - frightened . `` but it be dark ! how can we find we way ? '' `` the cock have crow ; we must start before the hen come out ; they might shout to Mr. Piperson . '' pig-wig sit down again , and commence to cry . `` come away pig-wig ; we can see when we get use to it . come ! I can hear they cluck ! '' pigle have never say shuh ! to a hen in he life , be peaceable ; also he remember the hamper . he open the house door quietly and shut it after they . there be no garden ; the neighborhood of Mr. Piperson 's be all scratch up by fowl . they slip away hand in hand across a untidy field to the road . the sun rise while they be cross the moor , a dazzle of light over the top of the hill . the sunshine creep down the slope into the peaceful green valley , where little white cottage nestle in garden and orchard . `` that be Westmorland , '' say Pig-wig . she drop Pigling 's hand and commence to dance , sing -- `` Tom , Tom , the piper 's son , steal a pig and away he run ! `` but all the tune that he could play , be ` over the hill and far away ! ' '' `` come , pig-wig , we must get to the bridge before folk be stir . '' `` why do you want to go to market , pigle ? '' inquire pig-wig presently . `` I do not want ; I want to grow potato . '' `` have a peppermint ? '' say pig-wig . pigle Bland refuse quite crossly . `` do you poor toothy hurt ? '' inquire pig-wig . pigle Bland grunt . pig-wig eat the peppermint herself and follow the opposite side of the road . `` pig-wig ! keep under the wall , there be a man ploughing . '' pig-wig cross over , they hurry down hill towards the county boundary . suddenly pigle stop ; he hear wheel . slowly jogging up the road below they come a tradesman 's cart . the rein flap on the horse 's back , the grocer be read a newspaper . `` take that peppermint out of you mouth , pig-wig , we may have to run . do not say one word . leave it to I . and in sight of the bridge ! '' say poor Pigling , nearly cry . he begin to walk frightfully lame , hold pig-wig 's arm . the grocer , intent upon he news - paper , might have pass they , if he horse have not shy and snort . he pull the cart crossway , and hold down he whip . `` Hallo ! where be you go to ? '' -- Pigling Bland stare at he vacantly . `` be you deaf ? be you go to market ? '' pigle nod slowly . `` I think as much . it be yesterday . Show I you licence ? '' pigle stare at the off hind shoe of the grocer 's horse which have pick up a stone . the grocer flick he whip -- `` Papers ? pig licence ? '' pigle fumble in all he pocket , and hand up the papers . the grocer read they , but still seem dissatisfied . `` this here pig be a young lady ; be she name Alexander ? '' pig-wig open she mouth and shut it again ; pigle cough asthmatically . the grocer run he finger down the advertisement column of he newspaper -- `` lose , steal or stray , 10 . reward . '' he look suspiciously at pig-wig . then he stand up in the trap , and whistle for the ploughman . `` you wait here while I drive on and speak to he , '' say the grocer , gather up the rein . he know that pig be slippery ; but surely , such a very lame pig could never run ! `` not yet , pig-wig , he will look back . '' the grocer do so ; he see the two pig stock-still in the middle of the road . then he look over at he horse 's heel ; it be lame also ; the stone take some time to knock out , after he get to the ploughman . `` now , pig-wig , now ! '' say Pigling Bland . never do any pig run as these pig run ! they race and squeal and pelt down the long white hill towards the bridge . little fat pig - wig 's petticoat flutter , and she foot go pitter , patter , pitter , as she bound and jump . they run , and they run , and they run down the hill , and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom , between pebble bed and rush . they come to the river , they come to the bridge -- they cross it hand in hand -- then over the hill and far away she dance with Pigling Bland ! the end
