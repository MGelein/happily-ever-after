the BEETLE . H. C. Andersen the emperor 's favorite horse be shoe with gold . it have a golden shoe on each of its foot . and why be this ? he be a beautiful creature , with delicate leg , bright intelligent eye , and a mane that hang down over he neck like a veil . he have carry he master through the fire and smoke of battle , and hear the bullet whistle around he , have kick , bitten , and take part in the fight when the enemy advance , and have spring with he master on he back over the fallen foe , and have save the crown of red gold , and the life of the emperor , which be more valuable than the red gold ; and that be why the emperor 's horse have golden shoe . and a beetle come creep forth . `` first the great one , '' say he , `` and then the little one ; but greatness be not the only thing that do it . '' and so say , he stretch out he thin leg . `` and pray what do you want ? '' ask the smith . `` golden shoe , to be sure , '' reply the beetle . `` why , you must be out of you sens , '' cry the smith . `` do you want to have golden shoe too ? '' `` golden shoe ? certainly , '' reply the beetle . `` be I not just as good as that big creature yonder , that be wait on , and brush , and have meat and drink put before he ? do not I belong to the imperial stable ? '' `` but _ why _ be the horse to have golden shoe ? do not you understand that ? '' ask the smith . `` understand ? I understand that it be a personal slight offer to myself , '' cry the beetle . `` it be do to annoy I , and therefore I be go into the world to seek my fortune . '' `` go along ! '' say the smith . `` you be a rude fellow ! '' cry the beetle ; and then he go out of the stable , fly a little way , and soon afterwards find himself in a beautiful flower garden , all fragrant with rose and lavender . `` be it not beautiful here ? '' ask one of the little lady-birds that fly about , with they delicate wing and they red-and-black shield on they back . `` how sweet it be here -- how beautiful it be ! '' `` I be accustomed to better thing , '' say the beetle . `` do you call _ this _ beautiful ? why , there be not so much as a dung-heap . '' then he go on , under the shadow of a great stack , and find a caterpillar crawl along . `` how beautiful the world be ! '' say the caterpillar : `` the sun be so warm , and everything so enjoyable ! and when I go to sleep , and die , as they call it , I shall wake up as a butterfly , with beautiful wing to fly with . '' `` how conceit you be ! '' exclaim the stag-beetle . `` fly about as a butterfly , indeed ! I have come out of the stable of the emperor , and no one there , not even the emperor 's favorite horse -- that by the way wear my cast-off golden shoe -- have any such idea . to have wing to fly ! why , we can fly now ; '' and he spread he wing and fly away . `` I do not want to be annoyed , and yet I be annoyed , '' he say , as he fly off . soon afterwards he fall down upon a great lawn . for awhile he lay there and feign slumber ; at last he fall asleep in earnest . suddenly a heavy shower of rain come fall from the cloud . the beetle wake up at the noise , and want to escape into the earth , but could not . he be tumble over and over ; sometimes he be swim on he stomach , sometimes on he back , and as for fly , that be out of the question ; he doubt whether he should escape from the place with he life . he therefore remain lie where he be . when the weather have moderate a little , and the beetle have rub the water out of he eye , he see something gleaming . it be linen that have be place there to bleach . he manage to make he way up to it , and creep into a fold of the damp linen . certainly the place be not so comfortable to lie in as the warm stable ; but there be no better to be have , and therefore he remain lie there for a whole day and a whole night , and the rain keep on during all the time . towards morning he creep forth : he be very much out of temper about the climate . on the linen two frog be sit . they bright eye absolutely gleam with pleasure . `` wonderful weather this ! '' one of they cry . `` how refresh ! and the linen keep the water together so beautifully . my hind leg seem to quiver as if I be go to swim . '' `` I should like to know , '' say the second , `` if the swallow , who fly so far round , in she many journey in foreign land ever meet with a better climate than this . what delicious dampness ! it be really as if one be lie in a wet ditch . whoever do not rejoice in this , certainly do not love he fatherland . '' `` have you be in the emperor 's stable ? '' ask the beetle : `` there the dampness be warm and refreshing . that be the climate for I ; but I can not take it with I on my journey . be there never a muck-heap , here in the garden , where a person of rank , like myself , can feel himself at home , and take up he quarter ? '' but the frog either do not or would not understand he . `` I never ask a question twice ! '' say the beetle , after he have already ask this one three time without receive any answer . then he go a little farther , and stumble against a fragment of pottery , that certainly ought not to have be lie there ; but as it be once there , it give a good shelter against wind and weather . here dwelt several family of earwig ; and these do not require much , only sociality . the female member of the community be full of the purest maternal affection , and accordingly each one consider she own child the most beautiful and cleverest of all . `` we son have engage himself , '' say one mother . `` dear , innocent boy ! he greatest hope be that he may creep one day into a clergyman 's ear . it be very artless and loveable , that ; and be engage will keep he steady . what joy for a mother ! '' `` we son , '' say another mother , `` have scarcely creep out of the egg , when he be already off on he travels . he be all life and spirit ; he 'll run he horn off ! what joy that be for a mother ! be it not so , Mr. Beetle ? '' for she know the stranger by he horny coat . `` you be both quite right , '' say he ; so they beg he to walk in ; that be to say , to come as far as he could under the bit of pottery . `` now , you also see _ my _ little earwig , '' observe a third mother and a fourth ; `` they be lovely little thing , and highly amusing . they be never ill-behaved , except when they be uncomfortable in they inside ; but , unfortunately , one be very subject to that at they age . '' thus each mother speak of she baby ; and the baby talk among themselves , and make use of the little nipper they have in they tail to nip the beard of the beetle . `` yes , they be always busy about something , the little rogue ! '' say the mother ; and they quite beam with maternal pride ; but the beetle feel bore by that , and therefore he inquire how far it be to the nearest muck-heap . `` that be quite out in the big world , on the other side of the ditch , '' answer a earwig . `` I hope none of my child will go so far , for it would be the death of I . '' `` but I shall try to get so far , '' say the beetle ; and he go off without take formal leave ; for that be consider the polite thing to do . and by the ditch he meet several friend ; beetle , all of they . `` here we live , '' they say . `` we be very comfortable here . Might we ask you to step down into this rich mud ? you must be fatigue after you journey . '' `` certainly , '' reply the beetle . `` I have be expose to the rain , and have have to lie upon linen , and cleanliness be a thing that greatly exhaust I . I have also pain in one of my wing , from standing in a draught under a fragment of pottery . it be really quite refresh to be among one 's companion once more . '' `` perhaps you come from some muck-heap ? '' observe the oldest of they . `` indeed , I come from a much higher place , '' reply the beetle . `` I come from the emperor 's stable , where I be bear with golden shoe on my foot . I be travel on a secret embassy . you must not ask I any question , for I can not betray my secret . '' with this the beetle step down into the rich mud . there sit three young maiden beetle ; and they titter , because they do not know what to say . `` not one of they be engage yet , '' say they mother ; and the beetle maiden titter again , this time from embarrassment . `` I have never see greater beauty in the royal stable , '' exclaim the beetle , who be now rest himself . `` do not spoil my girl , '' say the mother ; `` and do not talk to they , please , unless you have serious intention . but of course you intention be serious , and therefore I give you my blessing . '' `` Hurrah ! '' cry all the other beetle together ; and we friend be engage . immediately after the betrothal come the marriage , for there be no reason for delay . the following day pass very pleasantly , and the next in tolerable comfort ; but on the third it be time to think of food for the wife , and perhaps also for child . `` I have allow myself to be take in , '' say we beetle to himself . `` and now there be nothing for it but to take _ they _ in , in turn . '' so say , so do . away he go , and he stay away all day , and stay away all night ; and he wife sit there , a forsake widow . `` oh , '' say the other beetle , `` this fellow whom we receive into we family be nothing more than a thorough vagabond . he have go away , and have leave he wife a burden upon we hand . '' -lrb-B- illustration : the scholar find the BEETLE . aaaaa -rrb-B- aaa `` well , then , she shall be unmarried again , and sit here among my daughter , '' say the mother . `` fie on the villain who forsake she ! '' in the meantime the beetle have be journey on , and have sail across the ditch on a cabbage leaf . in the morning two person come to the ditch . when they see he , they take he up , and turn he over and over , and look very learn , especially one of they -- a boy . `` Allah see the black beetle in the black stone and in the black rock . be not that write in the Koran ? '' then he translate the beetle 's name into Latin , and enlarged upon the creature 's nature and history . the second person , a older scholar , vote for carry he home . he say they want just such good specimen ; and this seem a uncivil speech to we beetle , and in consequence he fly suddenly out of the speaker 's hand . as he have now dry wing , he fly a tolerable distance , and reach a hot-bed , where a sash of the glass roof be partly open , so he quietly slip in and bury himself in the warm earth . `` very comfortable it be here , '' say he . soon after he go to sleep , and dream that the emperor 's favorite horse have fall , and have give he he golden shoe , with the promise that he should have two more . that be all very charming . when the beetle wake up , he creep forth and look around he . what splendor be in the hothouse ! in the background great palm tree grow up on high ; the sun make they look transparent ; and beneath they what a luxuriance of green , and of beam flower , red as fire , yellow as amber , or white as fresh-fallen snow . `` this be a incomparable plenty of plant , '' cry the beetle . `` how good they will taste when they be decay ! a capital store-room this ! there must certainly be relation of mine living here . I will just see if I can find any one with whom I may associate . I be proud , certainly , and I be proud of be so . '' and so he prowl about in the earth , and think what a pleasant dream that be about the die horse , and the golden shoe he have inherit . suddenly a hand seize the beetle , and press he , and turn he round and round . the gardener 's little son and a companion have come to the hot-bed , have espy the beetle , and want to have they fun with he . first he be wrap in a vine leaf , and then put into warm trousers-pocket . he cribble and crabble about there with all he might ; but he get a good press from the boy 's hand for this , which serve as a hint to he to keep quiet . then the boy go rapidly towards the great lake that lay at the end of the garden . here the beetle be put in a old broken wooden shoe , on which a little stick be place upright for a mast , and to this mast the beetle be bind with a woollen thread . now he be a sailor , and have to sail away . the lake be not very large , but to the beetle it seem a ocean ; and he be so astonish at its extent , that he fall over on he back and kick out with he leg . the little ship sail away . the current of the water seize it ; but whenever it go too far from the shore , one of the boy turn up he trousers and go in after it , and bring it back to the land . but at length , just as it go merrily out again , the two boy be call away , and very harshly , so that they hurry to obey the summons , run away from the lake , and leave the little ship to its fate . thus it drive away from the shore , farther and farther into the open sea : it be terrible work for the beetle , for he could not get away in consequence of be bind to the mast . then a fly come and pay he a visit . `` what beautiful weather ! '' say the fly . `` I 'll rest here , and sun myself . you have a agreeable time of it . '' `` you speak without know the fact , '' reply the beetle . `` do not you see that I be a prisoner ? '' `` ah ! but I be not a prisoner , '' observe the fly ; and he fly away accordingly . `` well , now I know the world , '' say the beetle to himself . `` it be a abominable world . I be the only honest person in it . First , they refuse I my golden shoe ; then I have to lie on wet linen , and to stand in the draught ; and , to crown all , they fasten a wife upon I . then , when I have take a quick step out into the world , and find out how one can have it there , and how I wish to have it , one of those human boy come and tie I up , and leave I to the mercy of the wild wave , while the emperor 's favorite horse prance about proudly in golden shoe . that be what annoy I more than all . but one must not look for sympathy in this world ! my career have be very interesting ; but what be the use of that , if nobody know it ? the world do not deserve to be make acquaint with my history , for it ought to have give I golden shoe , when the emperor 's horse be shod , and I stretch out my foot to be shod too . if I have receive golden shoe , I should have become a ornament to the stable . now the stable have lose I , and the world have lose I . it be all over ! '' but all be not over yet . a boat , in which there be a few young girl , come rowing up . `` look , yonder be a old wooden shoe sailing along , '' say one of the girl . `` there be a little creature bind fast to it , '' say another . the boat come quite close to we beetle 's ship , and the young girl fish he out of the water . one of they draw a small pair of scissors from she pocket , and cut the woollen thread , without hurt the beetle ; and when she step on shore , she put he down on the grass . `` Creep , creep -- fly , fly -- if thou canst , '' she say . `` Liberty be a splendid thing . '' and the beetle fly up , and straight through the open window of a great building ; there he sink down , tire and exhaust , exactly on the mane of the emperor 's favorite horse , who stand in the stable when he be at home , and the beetle also . the beetle cling fast to the mane , and sit there a short time to recover himself . `` here I be sit on the emperor 's favorite horse -- sit on he just like the emperor himself ! '' he cry . `` but what be I say ? Yes , now I remember . that be a good thought , and quite correct . the smith ask I why the golden shoe be give to the horse . now I be quite clear about the answer . they be give to the horse on _ my _ account . '' and now the beetle be in a good temper again . `` travel expand the mind rarely , '' say he . the sun 's ray come stream into the stable , and shone upon he , and make the place lively and bright . `` the world be not so bad , upon the whole , '' say the beetle ; `` but one must know how to take thing as they come .
