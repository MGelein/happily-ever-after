the snow man . H. C. Andersen `` it be so wonderfully cold that my whole body crackle ! '' say the Snow man . `` this be a kind of wind that can blow life into one ; and how the gleam one up yonder be stare at I . '' he mean the sun , which be just about to set . `` it shall not make _ I _ wink -- I shall manage to keep the piece . '' he have two triangular piece of tile in he head instead of eye . he mouth be make of a old rake , and consequently be furnish with tooth . he have be bear amid the joyous shout of the boy , and welcome by the sound of sledge bell and the slash of whip . the sun go down , and the full moon rise , round , large , clear , and beautiful in the blue air . `` there it come again from the other side , '' say the Snow man . he intend to say the sun be show himself again . `` ah ! I have cure he of stare . now let he hang up there and shine , that I may see myself . if I only know how I could manage to move from this place , I should like so much to move . if I could , I would slide along yonder on the ice , just as I see the boy slide ; but I do not understand it ; I do not know how to run . '' `` away ! away ! '' bark the old Yard Dog . he be quite hoarse , and could not pronounce the genuine `` bow , wow . '' he have get the hoarseness from the time when he be a indoor dog , and lay by the fire . `` the sun will teach you to run ! I see that last winter , in you predecessor , and before that in _ he _ predecessor . away ! away ! -- and away they all go . '' `` I do not understand you , comrade , '' say the Snow man . `` that thing up yonder be to teach I to run ? '' he mean the moon . `` yes , it be run itself , when I see it a little while ago , and now it come creep from the other side . '' `` you know nothing at all , '' retort the Yard Dog . `` but then you have only just be patch up . what you see yonder be the moon , and the one that go before be the sun . it will come again to-morrow , and will teach you to run down into the ditch by the wall . we shall soon have a change of weather ; I can feel that in my left hind leg , for it prick and pain I : the weather be go to change . '' `` I do not understand he , '' say the Snow man ; `` but I have a feeling that he be talk about something disagreeable . the one who stare so just now , and whom he call the sun , be not my friend . I can feel that too . '' `` away ! away ! '' bark the Yard Dog ; and he turn round three time , and then creep into he kennel to sleep . the weather really change . towards morning , a thick damp fog lay over the whole region ; later there come a wind , a icy wind . the cold seem quite to seize upon one ; but when the sun rise , what splendor ! Trees and bush be cover with hoar frost , and look like a complete forest of coral , and every twig seem cover with gleam white bud . the many delicate ramification , conceal in summer by the wreath of leaf , now make they appearance : it seem like a lace-work , gleam white . a snowy radiance spring from every twig . the birch wave in the wind -- it have life , like the rest of the tree in summer . it be wonderfully beautiful . and when the sun shone , how it all gleam and sparkle , as if diamond dust have be strew everywhere , and big diamond have be drop on the snowy carpet of the earth ! or one could imagine that countless little light be gleam , whiter than even the snow itself . `` that be wonderfully beautiful , '' say a young girl , who come with a young man into the garden . they both stand still near the Snow Man , and contemplate the glittering tree . `` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight , '' say she ; and she eye sparkle . `` and we can not have such a fellow as this in summer-time , '' reply the young man , and he point to the Snow man . `` he be capital . '' the girl laugh , nod at the Snow Man , and then dance away over the snow with she friend -- over the snow that crack and crackle under she tread as if she be walk on starch . `` who be those two ? '' the Snow Man inquire of the Yard Dog . `` you have be longer in the yard than i. do you know they ? '' `` of course I know they , '' reply the Yard Dog . `` she have stroke I , and he have throw I a meat bone . I do not bite those two . '' `` but what be they ? '' ask the Snow man . `` lover ! '' reply the Yard Dog . `` they will go to live in the same kennel , and gnaw at the same bone . away ! away ! '' -lrb-B- illustration : the snow man and the yard dog . aaaaa -rrb-B- aaa `` be they the same kind of being as you and I ? '' ask the Snow man . `` why , they belong to the master , '' retort the Yard Dog . `` people certainly know very little who be only bear yesterday . I can see that in you . I have age , and information . I know every one here in the house , and I know a time when I do not lie out here in the cold , fasten to a chain . away ! away ! '' `` the cold be charming , '' say the Snow man . `` tell I , tell I . -- but you must not clank with you chain , for it jar within I when you do that . '' `` away ! away ! '' bark the Yard Dog . `` they tell I I be a pretty little fellow : then I use to lie in a chair cover with velvet , up in master 's house , and sit in the lap of the mistress of all . they use to kiss my nose , and wipe my paw with a embroidered handkerchief . I be call ` Ami -- dear Ami -- sweet Ami . ' but afterwards I grow too big for they , and they give I away to the housekeeper . so I come to live in the basement storey . you can look into that from where you be stand , and you can see into the room where I be master ; for I be master at the housekeeper 's . it be certainly a smaller place than upstairs , but I be more comfortable , and be not continually take hold of and pull about by child as I have be . I receive just as good food as ever , and even better . I have my own cushion , and there be a stove , the finest thing in the world at this season . I go under the stove , and could lie down quite beneath it . ah ! I still dream of that stove . away ! away ! '' `` do a stove look so beautiful ? '' ask the Snow man . `` be it at all like I ? '' `` it be just the reverse of you . it be as black as a crow , and have a long neck and a brazen drum . it eat firewood , so that the fire spurt out of its mouth . one must keep at its side , or under it , and there one be very comfortable . you can see it through the window from where you stand . '' and the Snow Man look and see a bright polished thing with a brazen drum , and the fire gleam from the lower part of it . the Snow Man feel quite strangely : a odd emotion come over he , he know not what it mean , and could not account for it ; but all people who be not snow man know the feeling . `` and why do you leave she ? '' ask the Snow Man , for it seem to he that the stove must be of the female sex . `` how could you quit such a comfortable place ? '' `` I be oblige , '' reply the Yard Dog . `` they turn I out of door , and chained I up here . I have bite the youngest young master in the leg , because he kick away the bone I be gnawing . ` bone for bone , ' I think . they take that very much amiss , and from that time I have be fasten to a chain and have lose my voice . do not you hear how hoarse I be ? away ! away ! I can not talk any more like other dog . away ! away ! that be the end of the affair . '' but the Snow man be no longer listen to he . he be look in at the housekeeper 's basement lodging , into the room where the stove stand on its four iron leg , just the same size as the Snow Man himself . `` what a strange crackling within I ! '' he say . `` Shall I ever get in there ? it be a innocent wish , and we innocent wish be certain to be fulfil . I must go in there and lean against she , even if I have to break through the window . '' `` you will never get in there , '' say the Yard Dog ; `` and if you approach the stove you 'll melt away -- away ! '' `` I be as good as go , '' reply the Snow man . `` I think I be break up . '' the whole day the Snow Man stand look in through the window . in the twilight hour the room become still more invite : from the stove come a mild gleam , not like the sun nor like the moon ; no , it be only as the stove can glow when he have something to eat . when the room-door open , the flame start out of he mouth ; this be a habit the stove have . the flame fall distinctly on the white face of the Snow Man , and gleam red upon he bosom . `` I can endure it no longer , '' say he ; `` how beautiful it look when it stretch out its tongue ! '' the night be long ; but it do not appear long to the Snow Man , who stand there lose in he own charming reflection , crackle with the cold . in the morning the window-panes of the basement lodge be cover with ice . they bear the most beautiful ice-flowers that any snow man could desire ; but they conceal the stove . the window-panes would not thaw ; he could not see the stove , which he picture to himself as a lovely female be . it crackle and whistle in he and around he ; it be just the kind of frosty weather a snow man must thoroughly enjoy . but he do not enjoy it ; and , indeed , how could he enjoy himself when he be stove-sick ? `` that be a terrible disease for a Snow Man , '' say the Yard Dog . `` I have suffer from it myself , but I get over it . away ! away ! '' he bark ; and he add , `` the weather be go to change . '' and the weather do change ; it begin to thaw . the warmth increase , and the Snow Man decrease . he say nothing , and make no complaint -- and that be a infallible sign . one morning he break down . and behold , where he have stand , something like a broomstick remain stick up out of the ground . it be the pole round which the boy have build he up . `` ah ! now I can understand why he have such a intense longing , '' say the Yard Dog . `` why , there be a shovel for clean out the stove fasten to the pole . the Snow Man have a stove-rake in he body , and that be what move within he . now he have get over that too . away ! away ! '' and soon they have get over the winter . `` away ! away ! '' bark the hoarse Yard Dog ; but the girl in the house sing : `` Green thyme ! from you house come out ; Willow , you woolly finger stretch out ; Lark and cuckoo cheerfully sing , for in February be come the spring . and with the cuckoo I 'll sing too , come thou , dear sun , come out , cuckoo ! '' and nobody think any more of the Snow man .
