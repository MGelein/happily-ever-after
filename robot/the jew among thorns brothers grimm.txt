110 the Jew among Thorns BrothersS Grimm there be once a rich man , who have a servant who serve he diligently and honestly : he be every morning the first out of bed , and the last to go to rest at night ; and , whenever there be a difficult job to be do , which nobody care to undertake , he be always the first to set himself to it . moreover , he never complain , but be contented with everything , and always merry . when a year be end , he master give he no wages , for he say to himself , `` that be the cleverest way ; for I shall save something , and he will not go away , but stay quietly in my service . '' the servant say nothing , but do he work the second year as he have do it the first ; and when at the end of this , likewise , he receive no wages , he make himself happy , and still stay on . when the third year also be past , the master consider , put he hand in he pocket , but pull nothing out . then at last the servant say , `` Master , for three year I have serve you honestly , be so good as to give I what I ought to have , for I wish to leave , and look about I a little more in the world . '' `` yes , my good fellow , '' answer the old miser ; `` you have serve I industriously , and , therefore , you shall be cheerfully reward ; '' and he put he hand into he pocket , but count out only three farthing , say , `` there , you have a farthing for each year ; that be large and liberal pay , such as you would have receive from few master . '' the honest servant , who understand little about money , put he fortune into he pocket , and think , `` ah ! now that I have my purse full , why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work ! '' so on he go , up hill and down dale ; and sing and jump to he heart 's content . now it come to pass that as he be go by a thicket a little man step out , and call to he , `` whither away , merry brother ? I see you do not carry many care . '' `` why should I be sad ? '' answer the servant ; `` I have enough ; three year ' wages be jingle in my pocket . '' `` how much be you treasure ? '' the dwarf ask he . `` how much ? three farthing sterling , all tell . '' `` look here , '' say the dwarf , `` I be a poor needy man , give I you three farthing ; I can work no longer , but you be young , and can easily earn you bread . '' and as the servant have a good heart , and feel pity for the old man , he give he the three farthing , say , `` take they in the name of Heaven , I shall not be any the worse for it . '' then the little man say , `` as I see you have a good heart I grant you three wish , one for each farthing , they shall all be fulfil . '' `` Aha ? '' say the servant , `` you be one of those who can work wonder ! well , then , if it be to be so , I wish , first , for a gun , which shall hit everything that I aim at ; secondly , for a fiddle , which when I play on it , shall compel all who hear it to dance ; thirdly , that if I ask a favor of any one he shall not be able to refuse it . '' `` all that shall you have , '' say the dwarf ; and put he hand into the bush , and only think , there lay a fiddle and gun , all ready , just as if they have be order . these he give to the servant , and then say to he , `` whatever you may ask at any time , no man in the world shall be able to deny you . '' `` Heart alive ! what can one desire more ? '' say the servant to himself , and go merrily onwards . soon afterwards he meet a Jew with a long goat 's - beard , who be stand listen to the song of a bird which be sit up at the top of a tree . `` good heaven , '' he be exclaim , `` that such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice ! if it be but mine ! if only someone would sprinkle some salt upon its tail ! '' `` if that be all , '' say the servant , `` the bird shall soon be down here ; '' and take aim he pull the trigger , and down fall the bird into the thorn-bushes . `` go , you rogue , '' he say to the Jew , `` and fetch the bird out for yourself ! '' `` oh ! '' say the Jew , `` leave out the rogue , my master , and I will do it at once . I will get the bird out for myself , as you really have hit it . '' then he lay down on the ground , and begin to crawl into the thicket . when he be fast among the thorn , the good servant 's humor so tempt he that he take up he fiddle and begin to play . in a moment the Jew 's leg begin to move , and to jump into the air , and the more the servant fiddle the better go the dance . but the thorn tear he shabby coat from he , comb he beard , and prick and pluck he all over the body . `` oh dear , '' cry the Jew , `` what do I want with you fiddling ? leave the fiddle alone , master ; I do not want to dance . '' but the servant do not listen to he , and think , `` you have fleece people often enough , now the thorn-bushes shall do the same to you ; '' and he begin to play over again , so that the Jew have to jump higher than ever , and scrap of he coat be leave hang on the thorn . `` oh , woe 's I ! cry the Jew ; I will give the gentleman whatsoever he ask if only he leave off fiddle a purse full of gold . '' `` if you be so liberal , '' say the servant , `` I will stop my music ; but this I must say to you credit , that you dance to it so well that it be quite a art ; '' and have take the purse he go he way . the Jew stand still and watch the servant quietly until he be far off and out of sight , and then he scream out with all he might , `` you miserable musician , you beer-house fiddler ! wait till I catch you alone , I will hunt you till the sole of you shoe fall off ! you ragamuffin ! just put five farthing in you mouth , and then you may be worth three halfpenny ! '' and go on abuse he as fast as he could speak . as soon as he have refresh himself a little in this way , and get he breath again , he run into the town to the justice . `` my lord judge , '' he say , `` I have come to make a complaint ; see how a rascal have rob and ill-treated I on the public highway ! a stone on the ground might pity I ; my clothes all torn , my body prick and scratch , my little all go with my purse , good ducat , each piece better than the last ; for God 's sake let the man be throw into prison ! '' `` be it a soldier , '' say the judge , `` who cut you thus with he sabre ? '' `` nothing of the sort ! '' say the Jew ; `` it be no sword that he have , but a gun hanging at he back , and a fiddle at he neck ; the wretch may easily be know . '' so the judge send he people out after the man , and they find the good servant , who have be go quite slowly along , and they find , too , the purse with the money upon he . as soon as he be take before the judge he say , `` I do not touch the Jew , nor take he money ; he give it to I of he own free will , that I might leave off fiddle because he could not bear my music . '' `` Heaven defend we ! '' cry the Jew , `` he lie be as thick as fly upon the wall . '' but the judge also do not believe he tale , and say , `` this be a bad defense , no Jew would do that . '' and because he have commit robbery on the public highway , he sentence the good servant to be hang . as he be be lead away the Jew again scream after he , `` you vagabond ! you dog of a fiddler ! now you be go to receive you well-earned reward ! '' the servant walk quietly with the hangman up the ladder , but upon the last step he turn round and say to the judge , `` Grant I just one request before I die . '' `` yes , if you do not ask you life , '' say the judge . `` I do not ask for life , '' answer the servant , `` but as a last favor let I play once more upon my fiddle . '' the Jew raise a great cry of `` murder ! murder ! for goodness ' sake do not allow it ! do not allow it ! '' but the judge say , `` why should I not let he have this short pleasure ? it have be grant to he , and he shall have it . '' however , he could not have refuse on account of the gift which have be bestow on the servant . then the Jew cry , `` oh ! woe 's I ! tie I , tie I fast ! '' while the good servant take he fiddle from he neck , and make ready . as he give the first scrape , they all begin to quiver and shake , the judge , he clerk , and the hangman and he man , and the cord fall out of the hand of the one who be go to tie the Jew fast . at the second scrape all raise they leg , and the hangman let go he hold of the good servant , and make himself ready to dance . at the third scrape they all leap up and begin to dance ; the judge and the Jew be the best at jump . soon all who have gather in the market-place out of curiosity be dance with they ; old and young , fat and lean , one with another . the dog , likewise , which have run there get up on they hind leg and caper about ; and the longer he play , the higher spring the dancer , so that they knock against each other 's head , and begin to shriek terribly . at length the judge cry , quite out of breath , `` I will give you you life if you will only stop fiddle . '' the good servant thereupon have compassion , take he fiddle and hang it round he neck again , and step down the ladder . then he go up to the Jew , who be lie upon the ground panting for breath , and say , `` you rascal , now confess , whence you get the money , or I will take my fiddle and begin to play again .
