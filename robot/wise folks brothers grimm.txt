'' he saddle the horse and ride off with all speed . he find the peasant who be sit under a willow-tree , and be just go to count the money in the purse . `` have you see the man who have fall down from Heaven ?

'' say he , and mount the horse and ride off in a quick trot . the youth remain sit there till night fall , but the peasant never come back . `` the man from Heaven must certainly have be in a great hurry , and would not turn back , '' think he , `` and the peasant have no doubt give he the horse to take to my father . '' he go home and tell he mother what have happen , and that he have send he father the horse so that he might not have to be always run about . `` Thou hast do well , '' answer she , `` thy leg be younger than he , and thou canst go on foot . '' when the peasant get home , he put the horse in the stable beside the cow which he have as a pledge , and then go to he wife and say , `` Trina , as you luck would have it , I have find two who be still sillier fool than you ; this time you escape without a beating , I will store it up for another occasion . '' then he light he pipe , sit down in he grandfather 's chair , and say , `` it be a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain , for two lean cow . if stupidity always bring in as much as that , I would be quite willing to hold it in honor . '' so think the peasant , but you no doubt prefer the simple folk .
