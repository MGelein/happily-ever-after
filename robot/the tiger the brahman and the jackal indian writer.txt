the TIGER , the BRAHMAN , and the JACKAL Indian Writer once upon a time , a tiger be catch in a trap . he try in vain to get out through the bar , and roll and bit with rage and grief when he fail . by chance a poor Brahman come by . `` let I out of this cage , oh pious one ! '' cry the tiger . `` Nay , my friend , '' reply the Brahman mildly , `` you would probably eat I if I do . '' `` not at all ! '' swear the tiger with many oath ; `` on the contrary , I should be for ever grateful , and serve you as a slave ! '' now when the tiger sob and sigh and weep and swear , the pious Brahman 's heart soften , and at last he consent to open the door of the cage . out pop the tiger , and , seize the poor man , cry , `` what a fool you be ! what be to prevent my eating you now , for after be coop up so long I be just terribly hungry ! '' in vain the Brahman plead for he life ; the most he could gain be a promise to abide by the decision of the first three thing he choose to question as to the justice of the tiger 's action . so the Brahman first ask a _ pipal _ tree what it think of the matter , but the _ pipal _ tree reply coldly , `` what have you to complain about ? do not I give shade and shelter to every one who pass by , and do not they in return tear down my branch to feed they cattle ? do not whimper -- be a man ! '' then the Brahman , sad at heart , go further afield till he see a buffalo turn a well-wheel ; but he fare no better from it , for it answer , `` you be a fool to expect gratitude ! look at I ! whilst I give milk they feed I on cotton-seed and oil-cake , but now I be dry they yoke I here , and give I refuse as fodder ! '' the Brahman , still more sad , ask the road to give he its opinion . `` my dear sir , '' say the road , `` how foolish you be to expect anything else ! here be I , useful to everybody , yet all , rich and poor , great and small , trample on I as they go past , give I nothing but the ash of they pipe and the husk of they grain ! '' on this the Brahman turn back sorrowfully , and on the way he meet a jackal , who call out , `` why , what be the matter , Mr. Brahman ? you look as miserable as a fish out of water ! '' the Brahman tell he all that have occur . `` how very confusing ! '' say the jackal , when the recital be end ; `` would you mind tell I over again , for everything have get so mixed up ? '' the Brahman tell it all over again , but the jackal shake he head in a distract sort of way , and still could not understand . `` it be very odd , '' say he , sadly , `` but it all seem to go in at one ear and out at the other ! I will go to the place where it all happen , and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment . '' so they return to the cage , by which the tiger be wait for the Brahman , and sharpen he tooth and claw . `` you have be away a long time ! '' growl the savage beast , `` but now let we begin we dinner . '' '' _ we _ dinner ! '' think the wretch Brahman , as he knee knock together with fright ; `` what a remarkably delicate way of put it ! '' `` give I five minute , my lord ! '' he plead , `` in order that I may explain matter to the jackal here , who be somewhat slow in he wit . '' the tiger consent , and the Brahman begin the whole story over again , not miss a single detail , and spinning as long a yarn as possible . `` oh , my poor brain ! oh , my poor brain ! '' cry the jackal , wring its paw . `` let I see ! how do it all begin ? you be in the cage , and the tiger come walk by -- '' `` Pooh ! '' interrupt the tiger , `` what a fool you be ! _ I _ be in the cage . '' `` of course ! '' cry the jackal , pretend to tremble with fright ; `` yes ! I be in the cage -- no I be not -- dear ! dear ! where be my wit ? let I see -- the tiger be in the Brahman , and the cage come walk by -- no , that be not it , either ! well , do not mind I , but begin you dinner , for I shall never understand ! '' `` yes , you shall ! '' return the tiger , in a rage at the jackal 's stupidity ; `` I 'll _ make _ you understand ! look here -- I be the tiger -- '' `` Yes , my lord ! '' `` and that be the Brahman -- '' `` Yes , my lord ! '' `` and that be the cage -- '' `` Yes , my lord ! '' `` and I be in the cage -- do you understand ? '' `` yes -- no -- please , my lord -- '' `` well ? '' cry the tiger impatiently . `` please , my lord ! -- how do you get in ? '' `` how ! -- why in the usual way , of course ! '' `` oh , dear I ! -- my head be begin to whirl again ! please do not be angry , my lord , but what be the usual way ? '' at this the tiger lose patience , and , jump into the cage , cry , `` this way ! now do you understand how it be ? '' `` perfectly ! '' grin the jackal , as he dexterously shut the door , `` and if you will permit I to say so , I think matter will remain as they be ! ''
