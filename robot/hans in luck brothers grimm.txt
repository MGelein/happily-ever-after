83 Hans in Luck BrothersS Grimm Hans have serve he master for seven year , so he say to he , `` Master , my time be up ; now I should be glad to go back home to my mother ; give I my wages . '' the master answer , `` you have serve I faithfully and honestly ; as the service be so shall the reward be ; '' and he give Hans a piece of gold as big as he head . Hans pull he handkerchief out of he pocket , wrap up the lump in it , put it on he shoulder , and set out on the way home . as he go on , always put one foot before the other , he see a horseman trot quickly and merrily by on a lively horse . `` ah ! '' say Hans quite loud , `` what a fine thing it be to ride ! there you sit as on a chair ; you stumble over no stone , you save you shoe , and get on , you do not know how . '' the rider , who have hear he , stop and call out , `` Hollo ! Hans , why do you go on foot , then ? '' `` I must , '' answer he , `` for I have this lump to carry home ; it be true that it be gold , but I can not hold my head straight for it , and it hurt my shoulder . '' `` I will tell you what , '' say the rider , `` we will exchange : I will give you my horse , and you can give I you lump . '' `` with all my heart , '' say Hans , `` but I can tell you , you will have to crawl along with it . '' the rider get down , take the gold , and help Hans up ; then give he the bridle tight in he hand and say , `` if you want to go at a really good pace , you must click you tongue and call out , `` jup ! jup ! '' Hans be heartily delighted as he sit upon the horse and ride away so bold and free . after a little while he think that it ought to go faster , and he begin to click with he tongue and call out , `` jup ! jup ! '' the horse put himself into a sharp trot , and before Hans know where he be , he be throw off and lie in a ditch which separate the field from the highway . the horse would have go off too if it have not be stop by a countryman , who be come along the road and drive a cow before he . Hans get he limb together and stand up on he leg again , but he be vex , and say to the countryman , `` it be a poor joke , this ride , especially when one get hold of a mare like this , that kick and throw one off , so that one have a chance of break one 's neck . never again will I mount it . now I like you cow , for one can walk quietly behind she , and have , over and above , one 's milk , butter and cheese every day without fail . what would I not give to have such a cow . '' `` well , '' say the countryman , `` if it would give you so much pleasure , I do not mind give the cow for the horse . '' Hans agree with the greatest delight ; the countryman jump upon the horse , and ride quickly away . Hans drive he cow quietly before he , and think over he lucky bargain . `` if only I have a morsel of bread -- and that can hardly fail I -- I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like ; if I be thirsty , I can milk my cow and drink the milk . good heart , what more can I want ? '' when he come to a inn he make a halt , and in he great content eat up what he have with he -- he dinner and supper -- and all he have , and with he last few farthing have half a glass of beer . then he drive he cow onward along the road to he mother 's village . as it draw nearer mid-day , the heat be more oppressive , and Hans find himself upon a moor which it take about a hour to cross . he feel it very hot and he tongue clave to the roof of he mouth with thirst . `` I can find a cure for this , '' think Hans ; `` I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk . '' he tie she to a withered tree , and as he have no pail he put he leather cap underneath ; but try as he would , not a drop of milk come . and as he set himself to work in a clumsy way , the impatient beast at last give he such a blow on he head with its hind foot , that he fall on the ground , and for a long time could not think where he be . by good fortune a butcher just then come along the road with a wheel-barrow , in which lay a young pig . `` what sort of a trick be this ? '' cry he , and help the good Hans up . Hans tell he what have happen . the butcher give he he flask and say , `` take a drink and refresh yourself . the cow will certainly give no milk , it be a old beast ; at the best it be only fit for the plough , or for the butcher . '' `` well , well , '' say Hans , as he stroke he hair down on he head , `` who would have think it ? certainly it be a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home ; what meat one have ! but I do not care much for beef , it be not juicy enough for I . a young pig like that now be the thing to have , it taste quite different ; and then there be the sausage ! '' `` Hark ye , Hans , '' say the butcher , `` out of love for you I will exchange , and will let you have the pig for the cow . '' `` Heaven repay you for you kindness ! '' say Hans as he give up the cow , whilst the pig be unbound from the barrow , and the cord by which it be tie be put in he hand . Hans go on , and think to himself how everything be go just as he wish ; if he do meet with any vexation it be immediately set right . presently there join he a lad who be carry a fine white goose under he arm . they say good morning to each other , and Hans begin to tell of he good luck , and how he have always make such good bargain . the boy tell he that he be take the goose to a christening-feast . `` just lift she , '' add he , and lay hold of she by the wing ; `` how heavy she be -- she have be fatten up for the last eight week . whoever have a bit of she when she be roasted will have to wipe the fat from both side of he mouth . '' `` yes , '' say Hans , as he weigh she in one hand , `` she be a good weight , but my pig be no bad one . '' meanwhile the lad look suspiciously from one side to the other , and shake he head . `` look here , '' he say at length , `` it may not be all right with you pig . in the village through which I pass , the Mayor himself have just have one steal out of its sty . I fear -- I fear that you have get hold of it there . they have send out some people and it would be a bad business if they catch you with the pig ; at the very least , you would be shut up in the dark hole . '' the good Hans be terrify . `` goodness ! '' he say , `` help I out of this fix ; you know more about this place than I do , take my pig and leave I you goose . '' `` I shall risk something at that game , '' answer the lad , `` but I will not be the cause of you get into trouble . '' so he take the cord in he hand , and drive away the pig quickly along a by-path . the good Hans , free from care , go homeward with the goose under he arm . `` when I think over it properly , '' say he to himself , `` I have even gain by the exchange ; first there be the good roast-meat , then the quantity of fat which will drip from it , and which will give I drip for my bread for a quarter of a year , and lastly the beautiful white feather ; I will have my pillow stuff with they , and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rock . how glad my mother will be ! '' as he be go through the last village , there stand a scissors-grinder with he barrow ; as he wheel whir he sing -- `` I sharpen scissors and quickly grind , my coat blow out in the wind behind . '' Hans stand still and look at he ; at last he speak to he and say , `` all 's well with you , as you be so merry with you grind . '' `` yes , '' answer the scissors-grinder , `` the trade have a golden foundation . a real grinder be a man who as often as he put he hand into he pocket find gold in it . but where do you buy that fine goose ? '' `` I do not buy it , but exchange my pig for it . '' `` and the pig ? '' `` that I get for a cow . '' `` and the cow ? '' `` I take that instead of a horse . '' `` and the horse ? '' `` for that I give a lump of gold as big as my head . '' `` and the gold ? '' `` well , that be my wages for seven year ' service . '' `` you have know how to look after yourself each time , '' say the grinder . `` if you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in you pocket whenever you stand up , you will have make you fortune . '' `` how shall I manage that ? '' say Hans . `` you must be a grinder , as I be ; nothing particular be want for it but a grindstone , the rest find itself . I have one here ; it be certainly a little worn , but you need not give I anything for it but you goose ; will you do it ? '' `` how can you ask ? '' answer Hans . `` I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth ; if I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket , what need I trouble about any longer ? '' and he hand he the goose and receive the grindstone in exchange . `` now , '' say the grinder , as he take up a ordinary heavy stone that lay by he , `` here be a strong stone for you into the bargain ; you can hammer well upon it , and straighten you old nail . take it with you and keep it carefully . '' Hans load himself with the stone , and go on with a contented heart ; he eye shine with joy . `` I must have be bear with a caul , '' he cry ; `` everything I want happen to I just as if I be a sunday-child . '' meanwhile , as he have be on he leg since daybreak , he begin to feel tired . hunger also torment he , for in he joy at the bargain by which he get the cow he have eat up all he store of food at once . at last he could only go on with great trouble , and be force to stop every minute ; the stone , too , weigh he down dreadfully . then he could not help think how nice it would be if he have not to carry they just then . he creep like a snail to a well in a field , and there he think that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water , but in order that he might not injure the stone in sit down , he lay they carefully by he side on the edge of the well . then he sit down on it , and be to stoop and drink , when he make a slip , push against the stone , and both of they fall into the water . when Hans see they with he own eye sink to the bottom , he jump for joy , and then kneel down , and with tear in he eye thank God for have show he this favor also , and deliver he in so good a way , and without he have any need to reproach himself , from those heavy stone which have be the only thing that trouble he . `` there be no man under the sun so fortunate as I , '' he cry out . with a light heart and free from every burden he now run on until he be with he mother at home .
