'' the story be as follow . one Sunday morning about harvest time , just as the buckwheat be in bloom , the sun be shine brightly in heaven , the east wind be blow warmly over the stubble-fields , the lark be sing in the air , the bee buzz among the buckwheat , the people be all go in they Sunday clothes to church , and all creature be happy , and the hedgehog be happy too . the hedgehog , however , be stand by he door with he arm akimbo , enjoy the morning breeze , and slowly trill a little song to himself , which be neither better nor worse than the song which hedgehog be in the habit of sing on a bless Sunday morning . Whilst he be thus sing half aloud to himself , it suddenly occur to he that , while he wife be wash and dry the child , he might very well take a walk into the field , and see how he turnip be go on . the turnip be , in fact , close beside he house , and he and he family be accustom to eat they , for which reason he look upon they as he own . no sooner say than do . the hedgehog shut the house-door behind he , and take the path to the field . he have not go very far from home , and be just turn round the sloe-bush which stand there outside the field , to go up into the turnip-field , when he observe the hare who have go out on business of the same kind , namely , to visit he cabbage . when the hedgehog catch sight of the hare , he bid he a friendly good morning . but the hare , who be in he own way a distinguished gentleman , and frightfully haughty , do not return the hedgehog 's greet , but say to he , assume at the same time a very contemptuous manner , `` how do you happen to be run about here in the field so early in the morning ? '' `` I be take a walk , '' say the hedgehog . `` a walk ! '' say the hare , with a smile . `` it seem to I that you might use you leg for a better purpose . '' this answer make the hedgehog furiously angry , for he can bear anything but a attack on he leg , just because they be crooked by nature . so now the hedgehog say to the hare , `` you seem to imagine that you can do more with you leg than I with mine . '' `` that be just what I do think , '' say the hare . `` that can be put to the test , '' say the hedgehog . `` I wager that if we run a race , I will outstrip you . '' `` that be ridiculous ! you with you short leg ! '' say the hare , `` but for my part I be willing , if you have such a monstrous fancy for it . what shall we wager ? '' `` a golden louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy , '' say the hedgehog . `` Done , '' say the hare . `` Shake hand on it , and then we may as well come off at once . '' `` Nay , '' say the hedgehog , `` there be no such great hurry ! I be still fast , I will go home first , and have a little breakfast . in half-an-hour I will be back again at this place . '' Hereupon the hedgehog depart , for the hare be quite satisfied with this . on he way the hedgehog think to himself , `` the hare rely on he long leg , but I will contrive to get the better of he . he may be a great man , but he be a very silly fellow , and he shall pay for what he have say . '' so when the hedgehog reach home , he say to he wife , `` wife , dress thyself quickly , thou must go out to the field with I . '' `` what be go on , then ? '' say he wife . `` I have make a wager with the hare , for a gold louis-d ` or and a bottle of brandy . I be to run a race with he , and thou must be present . '' `` good heaven , husband , '' the wife now cry , `` art thou not right in thy mind , hast thou completely lose thy wit ? what can make thee want to run a race with the hare ? '' `` hold thy tongue , woman , '' say the hedgehog , `` that be my affair . do not begin to discuss thing which be matter for man . be off , dress thyself , and come with I . '' what could the hedgehog 's wife do ? she be force to obey he , whether she like it or not . so when they have set out on they way together , the hedgehog say to he wife , `` now pay attention to what I be go to say . look you , I will make the long field we race-course . the hare shall run in one furrow , and I in another , and we will begin to run from the top . now all that thou hast to do be to place thyself here below in the furrow , and when the hare arrive at the end of the furrow , on the other side of thee , thou must cry out to he , ` I be here already ! ' '' then they reach the field , and the hedgehog show he wife she place , and then walk up the field . when he reach the top , the hare be already there . `` Shall we start ? '' say the hare . `` certainly , '' say the hedgehog . `` then both at once . '' so say , each place himself in he own furrow . the hare count , `` once , twice , thrice , and away ! '' and go off like a whirlwind down the field . the hedgehog , however , only run about three pace , and then he stoop down in the furrow , and stay quietly where he be . when the hare therefore arrive in full career at the lower end of the field , the hedgehog 's wife meet he with the cry , `` I be here already ! '' the hare be shock and wonder not a little , he think no other than that it be the hedgehog himself who be call to he , for the hedgehog 's wife look just like she husband . the hare , however , think to himself , `` that have not be do fairly , '' and cry , `` it must be run again , let we have it again . '' and once more he go off like the wind in a storm , so that he seem to fly . but the hedgehog 's wife stay quietly in she place . so when the hare reach the top of the field , the hedgehog himself cry out to he , `` I be here already . '' the hare , however , quite beside himself with anger , cry , `` it must be run again , we must have it again . '' `` all right , '' answer the hedgehog , `` for my part we 'll run as often as you choose . '' so the hare run seventy-three time more , and the hedgehog always hold out against he , and every time the hare reach either the top or the bottom , either the hedgehog or he wife say , `` I be here already . '' at the seventy-fourth time , however , the hare could no longer reach the end . in the middle of the field he fall to the ground , blood stream out of he mouth , and he lay dead on the spot . but the hedgehog take the louis-d ` or which he have win and the bottle of brandy , call he wife out of the furrow , and both go home together in great delight , and if they be not dead , they be live there still . this be how it happen that the hedgehog make the hare run race with he on the Buxtehuder heath till he die , and since that time no hare have ever have any fancy for run race with a Buxtehuder hedgehog . the moral of this story , however , be , firstly , that no one , however great he may be , should permit himself to jest at any one beneath he , even if he be only a hedgehog . and , secondly , it teach , that when a man marry , he should take a wife in he own position , who look just as he himself look . so whosoever be a hedgehog let he see to it that he wife be a hedgehog also , and so forth .
