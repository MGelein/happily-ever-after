'' `` May I invite no guest to this repast ? '' inquire the prince , `` no dinner be good without some company . '' the old woman laugh maliciously , and reply , `` Thou mayst invite one for the sake of companionship , but no more . '' the King 's son go to he servant and say to the Stout one , `` Thou shalt be my guest to-day , and shalt eat thy fill . '' Hereupon the Stout one stretch himself out and eat the three hundred ox without leave one single hair , and then he ask if he be to have nothing but he breakfast . he drink the wine straight from the cask without feel any need of a glass , and he lick the last drop from he finger-nails . when the meal be over , the prince go to the old woman , and tell she that the second task also be perform . she wonder at this and say , `` no one have ever do so much before , but one task still remain , '' and she think to herself , `` Thou shalt not escape I , and wilt not keep thy head on thy shoulder ! this night , '' say she , `` I will bring my daughter to thee in thy chamber , and thou shalt put thine arm round she , but when you be sit there together , beware of fall asleep . when twelve o'clock be striking , I will come , and if she be then no longer in thine arm , thou art lose . '' the prince thought , `` the task be easy , I will most certainly keep my eye open . '' nevertheless he call he servant , tell they what the old woman have say , and remark , `` who know what treachery lurk behind this ? foresight be a good thing keep watch , and take care that the maiden do not go out of my room again . '' when night fall , the old woman come with she daughter , and give she into the prince 's arm , and then the Tall one wound himself round the two in a circle , and the Stout one place himself by the door , so that no living creature could enter . there the two sit , and the maiden spake never a word , but the moon shone through the window on she face , and the prince could behold she wondrous beauty . he do nothing but gaze at she , and be fill with love and happiness , and he eye never feel weary . this last until eleven o'clock , when the old woman cast such a spell over all of they that they fall asleep , and at the self-same moment the maiden be carry away . then they all sleep soundly until a quarter to twelve , when the magic lose its power , and all awake again . `` oh , misery and misfortune ! '' cry the prince , `` now I be lose ! '' the faithful servant also begin to lament , but the Listener say , `` be quiet , I want to listen . '' then he listen for a instant and say , `` she be on a rock , three hundred league from hence , bewail she fate . Thou alone , Tall one , canst help she ; if thou wilt stand up , thou wilt be there in a couple of step . '' `` yes , '' answer the Tall one , `` but the one with the sharp eye must go with I , that we may destroy the rock . '' then the Tall one take the one with bandaged eye on he back , and in the twinkling of a eye they be on the enchant rock . the Tall one immediately take the bandage from the other 's eye , and he do but look round , and the rock shiver into a thousand piece . then the Tall one take the maiden in he arm , carry she back in a second , then fetch he companion with the same rapidity , and before it strike twelve they be all sit as they have sit before , quite merrily and happily . when twelve strike , the age sorceress come steal in with a malicious face , which seem to say , `` now he be mine !
