'' at this same moment up come , with a flock of sheep , the very shepherd who as the peasant know have long be wish to be Mayor , so he cry with all he might , `` no , I will not do it ; if the whole world insist on it , I will not do it ! '' the shepherd hearing that , come up to he , and ask , `` what art thou about ? what be it that thou wilt not do ? '' the peasant say , `` they want to make I Mayor , if I will but put myself in the barrel , but I will not do it . '' the shepherd say , `` if nothing more than that be needful in order to be Mayor , I would get into the barrel at once . '' the peasant say , `` if thou wilt get in , thou wilt be Mayor . '' the shepherd be willing , and get in , and the peasant shut the top down on he ; then he take the shepherd 's flock for himself , and drive it away . the parson go to the crowd , and declare that the mass have be say . then they come and roll the barrel towards the water . when the barrel begin to roll , the shepherd cry , `` I be quite willing to be Mayor .

Hast thou come out of the water ? '' `` yes , truly , '' reply the peasant , `` I sink deep , deep down , until at last I get to the bottom ; I push the bottom out of the barrel , and creep out , and there be pretty meadow on which a number of lamb be feed , and from thence I bring this flock away with I . '' Said the peasant , `` be there any more there ? '' `` oh , yes , '' say he , `` more than I could do anything with . '' then the peasant make up they mind that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves , a flock apiece , but the Mayor say , `` I come first . '' so they go to the water together , and just then there be some of the small fleecy cloud in the blue sky , which be call little lamb , and they be reflect in the water , whereupon the peasant cry , `` we already see the sheep down below ! '' the Mayor press forward and say , `` I will go down first , and look about I , and if thing promise well I 'll call you .
