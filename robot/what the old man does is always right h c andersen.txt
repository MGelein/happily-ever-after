what the OLD MAN DOES be ALWAYS RIGHT . H. C. Andersen I will tell you a story which be tell to I when I be a little boy . every time I think of the story , it seem to I to become more and more charming ; for it be with story as it be with many people -- they become better as they grow older . I take it for grant that you have be in the country , and see a very old farmhouse with a thatched roof , and moss and small plant grow wild upon the thatch . there be a stork 's nest on the summit of the gable ; for we can not do without the stork . the wall of the house be slope , and the window be low , and only one of the latter be make so that it will open . the baking-oven stick out of the wall like a little fat body . the elder tree hang over the paling , and beneath its branch , at the foot of the paling , be a pool of water in which a few duck be disport themselves . there be a yard-dog too , who bark at all comer . just such a farmhouse stand out in the country ; and in this house dwell a old couple -- a peasant and he wife . small as be they property , there be one article among it that they could do without -- a horse , which make a living out of the grass it find by the side of the high-road . the old peasant ride into the town on this horse ; and often he neighbor borrow it of he , and render the old couple some service in return for the loan of it . but they think it would be best if they sell the horse , or exchange it for something that might be more useful to they . but what might this _ something _ be ? `` you 'll know that best , old man , '' say the wife . `` it be fair-day to-day , so ride into town , and get rid of the horse for money , or make a good exchange : whichever you do will be right to I . ride to the fair . '' and she fasten he neckerchief for he , for she could do that better than he could ; and she tie it in a double bow , for she could do that very prettily . then she brush he hat round and round with the palm of she hand , and give he a kiss . so he ride away upon the horse that be to be sell or to be barter for something else . Yes , the old man know what he be about . the sun shone hotly down , and not a cloud be to be see in the sky . the road be very dusty , for many people who be all bind for the fair be drive , or ride , or walk upon it . there be no shelter anywhere from the sunbeam . among the rest , a man be trudge along , and drive a cow to the fair . the cow be as beautiful a creature as any cow can be . `` she give good milk , I be sure , '' say the peasant . `` that would be a very good exchange -- the cow for the horse . `` Hallo , you there with the cow ! '' he say ; `` I tell you what -- I fancy a horse cost more than a cow , but I do not care for that ; a cow would be more useful to I . if you like , we 'll exchange . '' `` to be sure I will , '' say the man ; and they exchange accordingly . so that be settle , and the peasant might have turn back , for he have do the business he come to do ; but as he have once make up he mind to go to the fair , he determine to proceed , merely to have a look at it ; and so he go on to the town with he cow . lead the animal , he stride sturdily on ; and after a short time , he overtake a man who be drive a sheep . it be a good fat sheep , with a fine fleece on its back . `` I should like to have that fellow , '' say we peasant to himself . `` he would find plenty of grass by we paling , and in the winter we could keep he in the room with we . perhaps it would be more practical to have a sheep instead of a cow . Shall we exchange ? '' the man with the sheep be quite ready , and the bargain be strike . so we peasant go on in the high-road with he sheep . soon he overtake another man , who come into the road from a field , carry a great goose under he arm . `` that be a heavy thing you have there . it have plenty of feather and plenty of fat , and would look well tie to a string , and paddle in the water at we place . that would be something for my old woman ; she could make all kind of profit out of it . how often she have say , ` if we only have a goose ! ' now , perhaps , she can have one ; and , if possible , it shall be hers . Shall we exchange ? I 'll give you my sheep for you goose , and thank you into the bargain . '' the other man have not the least objection ; and accordingly they exchange , and we peasant become proprietor of the goose . by this time he be very near the town . the crowd on the high-road become greater and greater ; there be quite a crush of man and cattle . they walk in the road , and close by the paling ; and at the barrier they even walk into the toll-man 's potato-field , where he one fowl be strut about , with a string to its leg , lest it should take fright at the crowd , and stray away , and so be lose . this fowl have short tail-feathers , and wink with both its eye , and look very cunning . `` Cluck , cluck ! '' say the fowl . what it think when it say this I can not tell you ; but directly we good man see it , he think , `` that be the finest fowl I have ever see in my life ! why , it be finer than we parson 's brood hen . on my word , I should like to have that fowl . a fowl can always find a grain or two , and can almost keep itself . I think it would be a good exchange if I could get that for my goose . `` Shall we exchange ? '' he ask the toll-taker . `` Exchange ! '' repeat the man ; `` well , that would not be a bad thing . '' and so they exchange ; the toll-taker at the barrier keep the goose , and the peasant carry away the fowl . now , he have do a good deal of business on he way to the fair , and he be hot and tired . he want something to eat , and a glass of brandy to drink ; and soon he be in front of the inn . he be just about to step in , when the hostler come out , so they meet at the door . the hostler be carry a sack . `` what have you in that sack ? '' ask the peasant . `` rotten apple , '' answer the hostler ; `` a whole sackful of they -- enough to feed the pig with . '' -lrb-B- illustration : the OLD MAN relate he success . aaaaa -rrb-B- aaa `` why , that be terrible waste ! I should like to take they to my old woman at home . last year the old tree by the turf-hole only bear a single apple , and we keep it on the cupboard till it be quite rotten and spoilt . ` it be always property , ' my old woman say ; but here she could see a quantity of property -- a whole sackful . yes , I shall be glad to show they to she . '' `` what will you give I for the sackful ? '' ask the hostler . `` what will I give ? I will give my fowl in exchange . '' and he give the fowl accordingly , and receive the apple , which he carry into the guest-room . he lean the sack carefully by the stove , and then go to the table . but the stove be hot : he have not think of that . many guest be present -- horse dealer , ox-herds , and two Englishmen -- and the two englishman be so rich that they pocket bulge out with gold coin , and almost burst ; and they could bet too , as you shall hear . hiss-s-s ! hiss-s-s ! what be that by the stove ? the apple be begin to roast ! `` what be that ? '' `` why , do you know -- , '' say we peasant . and he tell the whole story of the horse that he have change for a cow , and all the rest of it , down to the apple . `` well , you old woman will give it you well when you get home ! '' say one of the two Englishmen . `` there will be a disturbance . '' `` what ? -- give I what ? '' say the peasant . `` she will kiss I , and say , ` what the old man do be always right . ' '' `` Shall we wager ? '' say the Englishman . `` we 'll wager coin gold by the ton -- a hundred pound to the hundredweight ! '' `` a bushel will be enough , '' reply the peasant . `` I can only set the bushel of apple against it ; and I 'll throw myself and my old woman into the bargain -- and I fancy that be pile up the measure . '' `` Done -- take ! '' and the bet be make . the host 's carriage come up , and the Englishmen get in , and the peasant get in ; away they go , and soon they stop before the peasant 's hut . `` good evening , old woman . '' `` good evening , old man . '' `` I have make the exchange . '' `` yes , you understand what you be about , '' say the woman . and she embrace he , and pay no attention to the stranger guest , nor do she notice the sack . `` I get a cow in exchange for the horse , '' say he . `` Heaven be thank ! '' say she . `` what glorious milk we shall have , and butter and cheese on the table ! that be a capital exchange ! '' `` yes , but I change the cow for a sheep . '' `` ah , that be better still ! '' cry the wife . `` you always think of everything : we have just pasture enough for a sheep . Ewe 's - milk and cheese , and woollen jacket and stocking ! the cow can not give those , and she hair will only come off . how you think of everything ! '' `` but I change away the sheep for a goose . '' `` then this year we shall really have roast goose to eat , my dear old man . you be always think of something to give I pleasure . how charming that be ! we can let the goose walk about with a string to she leg , and she 'll grow fatter still before we roast she . '' `` but I give away the goose for a fowl , '' say the man . `` a fowl ? that be a good exchange ! '' reply the woman . `` the fowl will lay egg and hatch they , and we shall have chicken : we shall have a whole poultry-yard ! oh , that be just what I be wish for . '' `` yes , but I exchange the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apple . '' `` what ! -- I must positively kiss you for that , '' exclaim the wife . `` my dear , good husband ! now , I 'll tell you something . Do you know , you have hardly leave I this morning , before I begin think how I could give you something very nice this evening . I think it should be pancake with savoury herb . I have egg , and bacon too ; but I want herb . so I go over to the schoolmaster 's -- they have herb there , I know -- but the schoolmistress be a mean woman , though she look so sweet . I beg she to lend I a handful of herb . ` lend ! ' she answer I ; ` nothing at all grow in we garden , not even a shrivelled apple . I could not even lend you a shrivelled apple , my dear woman . ' but now _ I _ can lend _ she _ ten , or a whole sackful . that I be very glad of ; that make I laugh ! '' and with that she give he a sound kiss . `` I like that ! '' exclaim both the Englishmen together . `` always go down-hill , and always merry ; that be worth the money . '' so they pay a hundredweight of gold to the peasant , who be not scold , but kiss . Yes , it always pay , when the wife see and always assert that she husband know best , and that whatever he do be right . you see , that be my story . I hear it when I be a child ; and now you have hear it too , and know that `` what the old man do be always right . ''
