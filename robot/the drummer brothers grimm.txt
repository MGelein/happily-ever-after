'' the giant lift he up , and the drummer begin to beat he drum up aloft to he heart 's delight . the giant thought , `` that be the signal for the other people to turn back . '' after a while , a second giant be stand in the road , who take the drummer from the first , and stick he in he button-hole . the drummer lay hold of the button , which be as large as a dish , hold on by it , and look merrily around . then they come to a third giant , who take he out of the button-hole , and set he on the rim of he hat . then the drummer walk backwards and forwards up above , and look over the tree , and when he perceive a mountain in the blue distance , he think , `` that must be the glass-mountain , '' and so it be . the giant only make two step more , and they reach the foot of the mountain , where the giant put he down . the drummer demand to be put on the summit of the glass-mountain , but the giant shake he head , growl something in he beard , and go back into the forest . and now the poor drummer be stand before the mountain , which be as high as if three mountain be pile on each other , and at the same time as smooth as a looking-glass , and do not know how to get up it . he begin to climb , but that be useless , for he always slip back again . `` if one be a bird now , '' think he ; but what be the good of wish , no wing grow for he . Whilst he be stand thus , not know what to do , he see , not far from he , two man who be struggle fiercely together . he go up to they and see that they be dispute about a saddle which be lie on the ground before they , and which both of they want to have . `` what fool you be , '' say he , `` to quarrel about a saddle , when you have not a horse for it ! '' `` the saddle be worth fight about , '' answer one of the man ; `` whosoever sit on it , and wish himself in any place , even if it should be the very end of the earth , get there the instant he have utter the wish . the saddle belong to we in common . it be my turn to ride on it , but that other man will not let I do it . '' `` I will soon decide the quarrel , '' say the drummer , and he go to a short distance and stick a white rod in the ground . then he come back and say , `` now run to the goal , and whoever get there first , shall ride first . '' both put themselves into a trot ; but hardly have they go a couple of step before the drummer swing himself on the saddle , wish himself on the glass-mountain , and before any one could turn round , he be there . on the top of the mountain be a plain ; there stand a old stone house , and in front of the house lay a great fish-pond , but behind it be a dark forest . he see neither man nor animal , everything be quiet ; only the wind rustle amongst the tree , and the cloud move by quite close above he head . he go to the door and knock . when he have knock for the third time , a old woman with a brown face and red eye open the door . she have spectacles on she long nose , and look sharply at he ; then she ask what he want . `` entrance , food , and a bed for the night , '' reply the drummer . `` that thou shalt have , '' say the old woman , `` if thou wilt perform three service in return . '' `` why not ? '' he answer , `` I be not afraid of any kind of work , however hard it may be . '' the old woman let he go in , and give he some food and a good bed at night . the next morning when he have have he sleep out , she take a thimble from she wrinkled finger , reach it to the drummer , and say , `` go to work now , and empty out the pond with this thimble ; but thou must have it do before night , and must have seek out all the fish which be in the water and lay they side by side , accord to they kind and size . '' `` that be strange work , '' say the drummer , but he go to the pond , and begin to empty it . he bale the whole morning ; but what can any one do to a great lake with a thimble , even if he be to bale for a thousand year ? when it be noon , he think , `` it be all useless , and whether I work or not it will come to the same thing . '' so he give it up and sit down . then come a maiden out of the house who set a little basket with food before he , and say , `` what ail thee , that thou sittest so sadly here ? '' he look at she , and see that she be wondrously beautiful . `` ah , '' say he , `` I can not finish the first piece of work , how will it be with the other ? I come forth to seek a king 's daughter who be say to dwell here , but I have not find she , and I will go farther . '' `` Stay here , '' say the maiden , `` I will help thee out of thy difficulty . Thou art tire , lay thy head in my lap , and sleep . when thou awakest again , thy work will be do . '' the drummer do not need to be tell that twice . as soon as he eye be shut , she turn a wishing-ring and say , `` rise , water . fish , come out . '' instantly the water rise on high like a white mist , and move away with the other cloud , and the fish spring on the shore and lay themselves side by side each accord to he size and kind . when the drummer awake , he see with amazement that all be do . but the maiden say , `` one of the fish be not lie with those of its own kind , but quite alone ; when the old woman come to-night and see that all she demand have be do , she will ask thee , ` what be this fish lie alone for ? ' then throw the fish in she face , and say , ` this one shall be for thee , old witch . ' '' in the evening the witch come , and when she have put this question , he throw the fish in she face . she behave as if she do not remark it , and say nothing , but look at he with malicious eye . next morning she say , `` yesterday it be too easy for thee , I must give thee harder work . to-day thou must hew down the whole of the forest , split the wood into log , and pile they up , and everything must be finish by the evening . '' she give he a axe , a mallet , and two wedge . but the axe be make of lead , and the mallet and wedge be of tin . when he begin to cut , the edge of the axe turn back , and the mallet and wedge be beat out of shape . he do not know how to manage , but at mid-day the maiden come once more with he dinner and comfort he . `` lay thy head on my lap , '' say she , `` and sleep ; when thou awakest , thy work will be do . '' she turn she wishing-ring , and in a instant the whole forest fall down with a crash , the wood split , and arrange itself in heap , and it seem just as if unseen giant be finish the work . when he awake , the maiden say , `` dost thou see that the wood be pile up and arrange , one bough alone remain ; but when the old woman come this evening and ask thee about that bough , give she a blow with it , and say , ` that be for thee , thou witch . ' '' the old woman come , `` there thou seest how easy the work be ! '' say she ; `` but for whom hast thou leave that bough which be lie there still ? '' `` for thee , thou witch , '' he reply , and give she a blow with it . but she pretend not to feel it , laugh scornfully , and say , `` early to-morrow morning thou shalt arrange all the wood in one heap , set fire to it , and burn it . '' he rise at break of day , and begin to pick up the wood , but how can a single man get a whole forest together ? the work make no progress . the maiden , however , do not desert he in he need . she bring he he food at noon , and when he have eat , he lay he head on she lap , and go to sleep . when he awake , the entire pile of wood be burn in one enormous flame , which stretch its tongue out into the sky . `` listen to I , '' say the maiden , `` when the witch come , she will give thee all kind of order ; do whatever she ask thee without fear , and then she will not be able to get the better of thee , but if thou art afraid , the fire will lay hold of thee , and consume thee . at last when thou hast do everything , seize she with both thy hand , and throw she into the midst of the fire . '' the maiden depart , and the old woman come sneak up to he . `` oh , I be cold , '' say she , `` but that be a fire that burn ; it warm my old bone for I , and do I good ! but there be a log lie there which will not burn , bring it out for I . when thou hast do that , thou art free , and mayst go where thou likest , come ; go in with a good will . '' the drummer do not reflect long ; he spring into the midst of the flame , but they do not hurt he , and could not even singe a hair of he head . he carry the log out , and lay it down . hardly , however , have the wood touch the earth than it be transform , and the beautiful maiden who have help he in he need stand before he , and by the silken and shine golden garment which she wear , he know right well that she be the King 's daughter . but the old woman laugh venomously , and say , `` Thou thinkest thou hast she safe , but thou hast not get she yet ! '' just as she be about to fall on the maiden and take she away , the youth seize the old woman with both he hand , raise she up on high , and throw she into the jaw of the fire , which close over she as if it be delighted that a old witch be to be burnt . then the King 's daughter look at the drummer , and when she see that he be a handsome youth and remember how he have risk he life to deliver she , she give he she hand , and say , `` Thou hast venture everything for my sake , but I also will do everything for thine . Promise to be true to I , and thou shalt be my husband . we shall not want for riches , we shall have enough with what the witch have gather together here . '' she lead he into the house , where there be chest and coffer cram with the old woman 's treasure . the maiden leave the gold and silver where it be , and take only the precious stone . she would not stay any longer on the glass-mountain , so the drummer say to she , `` seat thyself by I on my saddle , and then we will fly down like bird . '' `` I do not like the old saddle , '' say she , `` I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home . '' `` very well , then , '' answer the drummer , `` then wish we in front of the town-gate . '' in the twinkling of a eye they be there , but the drummer say , `` I will just go to my parent and tell they the news , wait for I outside here , I shall soon be back . '' `` ah , '' say the King 's daughter , `` I beg thee to be careful . on thy arrival do not kiss thy parent on the right cheek , or else thou wilt forget everything , and I shall stay behind here outside , alone and desert . '' `` how can I forget thee ?

'' the poor King 's daughter have stand for a long time without the town wait for the return of the young man . when evening come , she say , `` he must certainly have kiss he parent on the right cheek , and have forget I . '' she heart be full of sorrow , she wish herself into a solitary little hut in a forest , and would not return to she father 's court . every evening she go into the town and pass the young man 's house ; he often see she , but he no longer know she . at length she hear the people say , `` the wedding will take place to-morrow . '' then she say , `` I will try if I can win he heart back . '' on the first day of the wedding ceremony , she turn she wishing-ring , and say , `` a dress as bright as the sun .

'' the bride could not overcome she desire and consent , but she mix a sleeping-draught with the wine she betroth take at night , which make he fall into a deep sleep , when all have become quiet , the King 's daughter crouch down by the door of the bedroom , open it just a little , and cry , `` drummer , drummer , I pray thee hear ! Hast thou forget thou heldest I dear ? that on the glass-mountain we sit hour by hour ? that I rescue thy life from the witch 's power ?

'' when she appear at the feast in the dress which be as soft as moonbeam , it again excite the desire of the bride , and the King 's daughter give it to she for permission to pass the second night also , outside the door of the bedroom . then in the stillness of the night , she cry , `` drummer , drummer , I pray thee hear !
