Mistress Pussy , how do you do ? '' `` I thank you kindly , little dog , I fare as well as you !

Duchess read the letter and write a answer : -- `` I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four . but it be very strange . _ I _ be just go to invite you to come here , to supper , my dear Ribby , to eat something most delicious . '' `` I will come very punctually , my dear Ribby , '' write Duchess ; and then at the end she add -- `` I hope it be not mouse ? '' and then she think that do not look quite polite ; so she scratch out `` be not mouse '' and change it to `` I hope it will be fine , '' and she give she letter to the postman . but she think a great deal about Ribby 's pie , and she read Ribby 's letter over and over again . `` I be dreadfully afraid it will be mouse ! '' say Duchess to herself -- `` I really could not , COULD not eat mouse pie . and I shall have to eat it , because it be a party . and MY pie be go to be veal and ham . a pink and white pie-dish ! and so be mine ; just like Ribby 's dish ; they be both buy at Tabitha Twitchit 's .
