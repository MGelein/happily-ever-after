the track in the SNOW Arthur Scott Bailey one fine winter 's day Fatty Coon come upon the queerest track in the snow . they be huge -- a great deal bigger , even , than bear-tracks , which Fatty have sometimes see , for once in a while , before the weather grow too cold , and he fall into he winter 's sleep , a bear would come down into the valley from he home on Blue Mountain . but these be six time as big as bear track . and Fatty feel a shiver of fear run up and down he back . he follow the trail a little way . but he be very careful . he be always ready to scramble up a tree , in case he should suddenly see the strange animal -- or rather , in case the strange animal should see HIM . the great track lead straight toward Farmer Green 's house . and Fatty do not want to go there . so he hurry home to ask he mother what he have find . Mrs. Coon listen to Fatty 's story . `` I think it must be the monster that almost catch I in the road last summer , '' say Fatty , mean the automobile that have give he a great fright . `` maybe he be come back again to catch Farmer Green and he family ... do you suppose he be eat they up ? '' Mrs. Coon be puzzle . and she be somewhat alarmed , too . she want to see those strange track herself . so she tell she other child not to step a foot out of the house until she come back . and then she ask Fatty to run along and show she where he have come upon the monster 's trail . Fatty Coon feel very important , as he lead the way across the swamp and into the wood . it be not often that he could show he mother anything . and he be so proud that he almost forget he fright . `` I guess you be glad I have sharp eye , '' he say , as they hurry along . `` if the track be as big as you say they be , you eye would not have to be very sharp to see they , '' he mother tell he . Mrs. Coon never like to hear she child boast . she know that boasting be one of the most unpleasant thing anyone can do . `` well -- maybe you do not think I see the monster 's track at all , '' say Fatty . `` maybe you do not think I hear he screech -- '' `` when do you hear he screech ? '' Mrs. Coon ask . `` this be the first you have say about SCREECHING . when be it ? '' `` last summer , '' Fatty answer . Mrs. Coon do not smile . perhaps she be too worried for that . `` it may not be the same monster , '' she say . `` it may not be a monster at all . '' but by this time Fatty be sure he be right . he be sure he know more than he mother . `` why can not we go right over to Farmer Green 's and take some of he chicken ? '' he ask . `` the monster have probably eat he by this time , and all he family , too . '' but Mrs. Coon would do no such thing . `` Show I the track , '' she say firmly . and so they go on into the wood . `` there they be ! '' Fatty cry , a few minute later . `` See , Mother ! they be even bigger than I say . '' he hear a funny noise behind he , then . and when Fatty Coon look around he see that he mother be actually hold she side , she be laugh so hard . `` those be Farmer Green 's track , '' she say , as soon as she could stop laugh long enough to speak . `` what -- as big as that ? '' Fatty point at the huge print in the snow . `` snowshoe ! '' Mrs. Coon say . `` he be wear snowshoe -- great frame make of thong and stick , to keep he from sink into the snow . '' so that be all there be to Fatty 's monster . somehow , he be disappoint . but he be very glad he have say nothing to Jasper Jay about he strange animal . for if he have , he know he would never have hear the last of it . and Fatty be glad about another thing , too . he feel very happy that he mother have not let he go after Farmer Green 's chicken .
