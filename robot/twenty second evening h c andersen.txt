TWENTY-SECOND EVENING . H. C. Andersen `` I look down upon Tyrol , '' say the Moon , `` and my beam cause the dark pine to throw long shadow upon the rock . I look at the picture of St. Christopher carry the Infant Jesus that be paint there upon the wall of the house , colossal figure reach from the ground to the roof . St. Florian be represent pour water on the burning house , and the Lord hung bleeding on the great cross by the wayside . to the present generation these be old picture , but I see when they be put up , and mark how one follow the other . on the brow of the mountain yonder be perch , like a swallow 's nest , a lonely convent of nun . two of the sister stand up in the tower toll the bell ; they be both young , and therefore they glance fly over the mountain out into the world . a travel coach pass by below , the postillion wind he horn , and the poor nun look after the carriage for a moment with a mournful glance , and a tear gleam in the eye of the younger one . and the horn sound faint and more faintly , and the convent bell drown its expire echo .
