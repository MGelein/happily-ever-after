'' `` oh , come with I , '' say the man , `` if we three be together , we certainly ought to be able to get on in the world ! '' the huntsman be ready , and go with he , and they come to seven windmill whose sail be turn round with great speed , and yet no wind be blow either on the right or the left , and no leaf be stir . then say the man , `` I know not what be drive the windmill , not a breath of air be stir , '' and he go onward with he servant , and when they have walk two mile they see a man sit on a tree who be shut one nostril , and blow out of the other . `` good gracious ! what be you do up there ?

'' `` oh , come with I , '' say the master . `` if we six be together , we can carry the whole world before we . '' now the six come to a town where the King have proclaim that whosoever run a race with he daughter and win the victory , should be she husband , but whosoever lose it , must lose he head . then the man present himself and say , `` I will , however , let my servant run for I .

'' when that be settle and make secure , the man buckle the other leg on the runner , and say to he , `` now be nimble , and help we to win . '' it be fix that the one who be first to bring some water from a far distant well be to be the victor . the runner receive a pitcher , and the King 's daughter one too , and they begin to run at the same time , but in a instant , when the King 's daughter have get a very little way , the people who be look on could see no more of the runner , and it be just as if the wind have whistle by . in a short time he reach the well , fill he pitcher with water , and turn back . half-way home , however , he be overcome with fatigue , and set he pitcher down , lay down himself , and fall asleep . he have , however , make a pillow of a horse 's skull which be lie on the ground , in order that he might lie uncomfortably , and soon wake up again . in the meantime the King 's daughter , who could also run very well quite as well as any ordinary mortal can have reach the well , and be hurry back with she pitcher full of water , and when she see the runner lie there asleep , she be glad and say , `` my enemy be deliver over into my hand , '' empty he pitcher , and run on . and now all would have be lose if by good luck the huntsman have not be stand at the top of the castle , and have not see everything with he sharp eye . then say he , `` the King 's daughter shall still not prevail against we ; '' and he load he gun , and shot so cleverly , that he shoot the horse 's skull away from under the runner 's head without hurt he . then the runner awake , leap up , and see that he pitcher be empty , and that the King 's daughter be already far in advance . he do not lose heart , however , but run back to the well with he pitcher , again draw some water , and be at home again , ten minute before the King 's daughter . `` Behold ! '' say he , `` I have not bestir myself till now , it do not deserve to be call run before . '' but it pained the King , and still more he daughter , that she should be carry off by a common disbanded soldier like that ; so they take counsel with each other how to get rid of he and he companion . then say the King to she , `` I have think of a way ; do not be afraid , they shall not come back again . '' and he say to they , `` you shall now make merry together , and eat and drink , '' and he conduct they to a room which have a floor of iron , and the door also be of iron , and the window be guard with iron bar . there be a table in the room cover with delicious food , and the King say to they , `` go in , and enjoy yourselve . '' and when they be inside , he order the door to be shut and bolt . then he send for the cook , and command he to make a fire under the room until the iron become red-hot . this the cook do , and the six who be sit at table begin to feel quite warm , and they think the heat be cause by the food ; but as it become still greater , and they want to get out , and find that the door and window be bolt , they become aware that the King must have a evil intention , and want to suffocate they . `` he shall not succeed , however , '' say the one with the cap . `` I will cause a frost to come , before which the fire shall be ashamed , and creep away . '' then he put he cap on straight , and immediately there come such a frost that all heat disappear , and the food on the dish begin to freeze . when a hour or two have pass by , and the King believe that they have perish in the heat , he have the door open to behold they himself . but when the door be open , all six be stand there , alive and well , and say that they should very much like to get out to warm themselves , for the very food be fast freeze to the dish with the cold . then , full of anger , the King go down to the cook , scold he , and ask why he have not do what he have be order to do . but the cook reply , `` there be heat enough there , just look yourself . '' then the King see that a fierce fire be burn under the iron room , and perceive that there be no get the better of the six in this way . again the King consider how to get rid of he unpleasant guest , and cause they chief to be bring and say , `` if thou wilt take gold and renounce my daughter , thou shalt have as much as thou wilt . '' `` oh , yes , Lord King , '' he answer , `` give I as much as my servant can carry , and I will not ask for you daughter . '' on this the King be satisfy , and the other continued , `` in fourteen day , I will come and fetch it . '' Thereupon he summon together all the tailor in the whole kingdom , and they be to sit for fourteen day and sew a sack . and when it be ready , the strong one who could tear up tree have to take it on he back , and go with it to the King . then say the King , `` who can that strong fellow be who be carry a bundle of linen on he back that be as big as a house ? '' and he be alarm and say , `` what a lot of gold he can carry away ! '' then he command a ton of gold to be bring ; it take sixteen of he strongest man to carry it , but the strong one snatch it up in one hand , put it in he sack , and say , `` why do not you bring more at the same time ? that hardly cover the bottom ! '' then , little by little , the King cause all he treasure to be bring thither , and the strong one push it into the sack , and still the sack be not half full with it . `` bring more , '' cry he , `` these few crumb do not fill it . '' then seven thousand cart with gold have to be gather together in the whole kingdom , and the strong one thrust they and the ox harness to they into he sack . `` I will examine it no longer , '' say he , `` but will just take what come , so long as the sack be but full . '' when all that be inside , there be still room for a great deal more ; then he say , `` I will just make a end of the thing ; people do sometimes tie up a sack even when it be not full . '' so he take it on he back , and go away with he comrade . when the King now see how one single man be carry away the entire wealth of the country , he become enraged , and bid he horseman mount and pursue the six , and order they to take the sack away from the strong one . two regiment speedily overtake the six , and call out , `` you be prisoner , put down the sack with the gold , or you will all be cut to piece ! '' `` what say you ? '' cry the blower , `` that we be prisoner ! rather than that should happen , all of you shall dance about in the air . '' and he close one nostril , and with the other blow on the two regiment . then they be drive away from each other , and carry into the blue sky over all the mountain one here , the other there . one sergeant cry for mercy ; he have nine wound , and be a brave fellow who do not deserve ill treatment . the blower stop a little so that he come down without injury , and then the blower say to he , `` now go home to thy King , and tell he he have better send some more horseman , and I will blow they all into the air . '' when the King be inform of this he say , `` let the rascal go . they have the best of it . '' then the six convey the riches home , divide it amongst they , and live in content until they death .
