TWELFTH evening . H. C. Andersen `` I look through the window of a editor 's house , '' say the moon . `` it be somewhere in Germany . I see handsome furniture , many book , and a chaos of newspaper . several young man be present : the editor himself stand at he desk , and two little book , both by young author , be to be notice . ` this one have be send to I , ' say he . ` I have not read it yet ; what think _ you _ of the contents ? ' ` oh , ' say the person address -- he be a poet himself -- ` it be good enough ; a little broad , certainly ; but , you see , the author be still young . the verse might be better , to be sure ; the thought be sound , though there be certainly a good deal of commonplace among they . but what will you have ? you can not be always get something new . that he 'll turn out anything great I do not believe , but you may safely praise he . he be well read , a remarkable oriental scholar , and have a good judgment . it be he who write that nice review of my ` reflection on Domestic Life . ' we must be lenient towards the young man . ' '' ` but he be a complete hack ! ' object another of the gentleman . ` nothing be worse in poetry than mediocrity , and he certainly do not go beyond this . ' '' ` Poor fellow , ' observe a third , ` and he aunt be so happy about he . it be she , Mr. Editor , who get together so many subscriber for you last translation . ' '' ` ah , the good woman ! well , I have notice the book briefly . undoubted talent -- a welcome offering -- a flower in the garden of poetry -- prettily bring out -- and so on . but this other book -- I suppose the author expect I to purchase it ? I hear it be praise . he have genius , certainly ; do not you think so ? ' '' ` yes , all the world declare as much , ' reply the poet , ` but it have turn out rather wildly . the punctuation of the book , in particular , be very eccentric . ' '' ` it will be good for he if we pull he to piece , and anger he a little , otherwise he will get too good a opinion of himself . ' '' ` but that would be unfair , ' object the fourth . ` let we not carp at little fault , but rejoice over the real and abundant good that we find here : he surpass all the rest . ' '' ` not so . if he be a true genius , he can bear the sharp voice of censure . there be people enough to praise he . do not let we quite turn he head . ' '' ` decided talent , ' write the editor , ` with the usual carelessness . that he can write incorrect verse may be see in page 25 , where there be two false quantity . we recommend he to study the ancient , etc. ' `` I go away , '' continue the Moon , `` and look through the window in the aunt 's house . there sit the be-praised poet , the _ tame _ one ; all the guest pay homage to he , and he be happy . `` I seek the other poet out , the _ wild _ one ; he also I find in a great assembly at he patron 's , where the tame poet 's book be be discuss . '' ` I shall read yours also , ' say Maecenas ; ` but to speak honestly -- you know I never hide my opinion from you -- I do not expect much from it , for you be much too wild , too fantastic . but it must be allow that , as a man , you be highly respectable . ' `` a young girl sit in a corner ; and she read in a book these word : '' ` in the dust lie genius and glory , but ev ` ry-day talent will _ pay _ . it be only the old , old story , but the piece be repeat each day .
