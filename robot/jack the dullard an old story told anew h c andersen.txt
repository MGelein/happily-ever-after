jack the DULLARD . a OLD STORY tell anew . H. C. Andersen Far in the interior of the country lay a old baronial hall , and in it live a old proprietor , who have two son , which two young man think themselves too clever by half . they want to go out and woo the king 's daughter ; for the maiden in question have publicly announce that she would choose for she husband that youth who could arrange he word best . so these two genius prepare themselves a full week for the woo -- this be the longest time that could be grant they ; but it be enough , for they have have much preparatory information , and everybody know how useful that be . one of they know the whole latin dictionary by heart , and three whole year of the daily paper of the little town into the bargain ; and so well , indeed , that he could repeat it all either backwards or forwards , just as he choose . the other be deeply read in the corporation law , and know by heart what every corporation ought to know ; and accordingly he think he could talk of affair of state , and put he speak in the wheel in the council . and he know one thing more : he could embroider brace with rose and other flower , and with arabesque , for he be a tasty , light-fingered fellow . `` I shall win the princess ! '' so cry both of they . therefore they old papa give to each a handsome horse . the youth who know the dictionary and newspaper by heart have a black horse , and he who know all about the corporation law receive a milk-white steed . then they rub the corner of they mouth with fish-oil , so that they might become very smooth and glib . all the servant stand below in the courtyard , and look on while they mount they horse ; and just by chance the third son come up . for the proprietor have really three son , though nobody count the third with he brother , because he be not so learn as they , and indeed he be generally know as `` Jack the Dullard . '' `` Hallo ! '' say Jack the Dullard , `` where be you go ? I declare you have put on you Sunday clothes ! '' `` we be go to the king 's court , as suitor to the king 's daughter . do not you know the announcement that have be make all through the country ? '' and they tell he all about it . `` my word ! I 'll be in it too ! '' cry Jack the Dullard ; and he two brother burst out laugh at he , and ride away . `` Father dear , '' say Jack , `` I must have a horse too . I do feel so desperately incline to marry ! if she accept I , she accept I ; and if she will not have I , I 'll have she ; but she _ shall _ be mine ! '' `` do not talk nonsense , '' reply the old gentleman . `` you shall have no horse from I . you do not know how to speak -- you can not arrange you word . you brother be very different fellow from you . '' `` well , '' quoth Jack the Dullard , `` if I can not have a horse , I 'll take the billy-goat , who belong to I , and he can carry I very well ! '' and so say , so do . he mount the billy-goat , press he heel into its side , and gallopp down the high street like a hurricane . `` Hei , houp ! that be a ride ! here I come ! '' shout Jack the Dullard , and he sing till he voice echo far and wide . but he brother ride slowly on in advance of he . they speak not a word , for they be think about all the fine extempore speech they would have to bring out , and all these have to be cleverly prepare beforehand . `` Hallo ! '' shout Jack the Dullard . `` here be I ! look what I have find on the high-road . '' and he show they what it be , and it be a dead crow . `` Dullard ! '' exclaim the brother , `` what be you go to do with that ? '' `` with the crow ? why , I be go to give it to the princess . '' `` yes , do so , '' say they ; and they laugh , and ride on . `` Hallo , here I be again ! just see what I have find now : you do not find that on the high-road every day ! '' and the brother turn round to see what he could have find now . `` Dullard ! '' they cry , `` that be only a old wooden shoe , and the upper part be miss into the bargain ; be you go to give that also to the princess ? '' `` most certainly I shall , '' reply Jack the Dullard ; and again the brother laugh and ride on , and thus they get far in advance of he ; but -- `` Hallo -- hop rara ! '' and there be Jack the Dullard again . `` it be get better and better , '' he cry . `` Hurrah ! it be quite famous . '' `` why , what have you find this time ? '' inquire the brother . `` oh , '' say Jack the Dullard , `` I can hardly tell you . how glad the princess will be ! '' `` bah ! '' say the brother ; `` that be nothing but clay out of the ditch . '' `` yes , certainly it be , '' say Jack the Dullard ; `` and clay of the finest sort . See , it be so wet , it run through one 's finger . '' and he fill he pocket with the clay . but he brother gallopp on till the spark fly , and consequently they arrive a full hour earlier at the town-gate than could Jack . now at the gate each suitor be provide with a number , and all be place in row immediately on they arrival , six in each row , and so closely pack together that they could not move they arm ; and that be a prudent arrangement , for they would certainly have come to blow , have they be able , merely because one of they stand before the other . all the inhabitant of the country round about stand in great crowd around the castle , almost under the very window , to see the princess receive the suitor ; and as each step into the hall , he power of speech seem to desert he , like the light of a candle that be blow out . then the princess would say , `` he be of no use ! away with he out of the hall ! '' at last the turn come for that brother who know the dictionary by heart ; but he do not know it now ; he have absolutely forget it altogether ; and the board seem to re-echo with he footstep , and the ceiling of the hall be make of looking-glass , so that he see himself stand on he head ; and at the window stand three clerk and a head clerk , and every one of they be write down every single word that be utter , so that it might be print in the newspaper , and sell for a penny at the street corner . it be a terrible ordeal , and they have moreover make such a fire in the stove , that the room seem quite red hot . `` it be dreadfully hot here ! '' observe the first brother . `` yes , '' reply the princess , `` my father be go to roast young pullet to-day . '' `` baa ! '' there he stand like a baa-lamb . he have not be prepare for a speech of this kind ; and have not a word to say , though he intend to say something witty . `` baa ! '' `` he be of no use ! '' say the princess . `` away with he . '' and he be oblige to go accordingly . and now the second brother come in . `` it be terribly warm here ! '' he observe . `` yes , we be roast pullet to-day , '' reply the princess . `` what -- what be you -- be you please to ob -- '' stammer he -- and all the clerk write down , `` pleased to ob -- '' `` he be of no use ! '' say the princess . `` away with he ! '' now come the turn of Jack the Dullard . he ride into the hall on he goat . `` well , it be most abominably hot here . '' `` yes , because I be roast young pullet , '' reply the princess . `` ah , that be lucky ! '' exclaim Jack the Dullard , `` for I suppose you 'll let I roast my crow at the same time ? '' `` with the greatest pleasure , '' say the princess . `` but have you anything you can roast it in ? for I have neither pot nor pan . '' `` certainly I have ! '' say Jack . `` here be a cooking utensil with a tin handle . '' and he bring out the old wooden shoe , and put the crow into it . `` well , that _ be _ a famous dish ! '' say the princess . `` but what shall we do for sauce ? '' `` oh , I have that in my pocket , '' say Jack : `` I have so much of it , that I can afford to throw some away ; '' and he pour some of the clay out of he pocket . `` I like that ! '' say the princess . `` you can give a answer , and you have something to say for yourself , and so you shall be my husband . but be you aware that every word we speak be be take down , and will be publish in the paper to-morrow ? look yonder , and you will see in every window three clerk and a head clerk ; and the old head clerk be the worst of all , for he can not understand anything . '' but she only say this to frighten Jack the Dullard : and the clerk give a great crow of delight , and each one spurt a blot out of he pen on to the floor . `` oh , those be the gentleman , be they ? '' say Jack ; `` then I will give the best I have to the head clerk . '' and he turn out he pocket , and fling the wet clay full in the head clerk 's face . `` that be very cleverly do , '' observe the princess . `` I could not have do that ; but I shall learn in time . '' and accordingly Jack the Dullard be make a king , and receive a crown and a wife , and sit upon a throne . and this report we have wet from the press of the head clerk and the corporation of printer -- but they be not to be depend upon in the least !
