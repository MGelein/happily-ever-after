the LAMBIKIN Indian Writer once upon a time there be a wee wee Lambikin , who frolic about on he little tottery leg , and enjoy himself amazingly . now one day he set off to visit he Granny , and be jump with joy to think of all the good thing he should get from she , when who should he meet but a Jackal , who look at the tender young morsel and say : `` Lambikin ! Lambikin ! I 'll eat you ! '' but Lambikin only give a little frisk and say : `` to Granny 's house I go , where I shall fatter grow , then you can eat I so . '' the Jackal think this reasonable , and let Lambikin pass . by-and-by he meet a Vulture , and the Vulture , look hungrily at the tender morsel before he , say : `` Lambikin ! Lambikin ! I 'll eat you ! '' but Lambikin only give a little frisk , and say : `` to Granny 's house I go , where I shall fatter grow , then you can eat I so . '' the Vulture think this reasonable , and let Lambikin pass . and by-and-by he meet a Tiger , and then a Wolf , and a Dog , and a Eagle , and all these , when they see the tender little morsel , say : `` Lambikin ! Lambikin ! I 'll eat you ! '' but to all of they Lambikin reply , with a little frisk : `` to Granny 's house I go , where I shall fatter grow , then you can eat I so . '' at last he reach he Granny 's house , and say , all in a great hurry , `` Granny , dear , I have promise to get very fat ; so , as people ought to keep they promise , please put I into the corn-bin _ at once _ . '' so he Granny say he be a good boy , and put he into the corn-bin , and there the greedy little Lambikin stay for seven day , and eat , and eat , and eat , until he could scarcely waddle , and he Granny say he be fat enough for anything , and must go home . but cunning little Lambikin say that would never do , for some animal would be sure to eat he on the way back , he be so plump and tender . `` I 'll tell you what you must do , '' say Master Lambikin , `` you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who die , and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely , for I be as tight as a drum myself . '' so he Granny make a nice little drumikin out of he brother 's skin , with the wool inside , and Lambikin curl himself up snug and warm in the middle , and trundle away gaily . soon he meet with the Eagle , who call out : `` Drumikin ! Drumikin ! Have you see Lambikin ? '' and Mr. Lambikin , curl up in he soft warm nest , reply : `` Fallen into the fire , and so will you on little Drumikin . tum-pa , tum-too ! '' `` how very annoy ! '' sigh the Eagle , think regretfully of the tender morsel he have let slip . meanwhile Lambikin trundle along , laugh to himself , and singing : `` tum-pa , tum-too ; tum-pa , tum-too ! '' every animal and bird he meet ask he the same question : `` Drumikin ! Drumikin ! Have you see Lambikin ? '' and to each of they the little slyboot reply : `` Fallen into the fire , and so will you on little Drumikin . tum-pa , tum too ; tum-pa , tum-too ; tum-pa , tum-too ! '' then they all sigh to think of the tender little morsel they have let slip . at last the Jackal come limp along , for all he sorry look as sharp as a needle , and he too call out -- `` Drumikin ! Drumikin ! Have you see Lambikin ? '' and Lambikin , curl up in he snug little nest , reply gaily : `` Fallen into the fire , and so will you on little Drumikin ! tum-pa -- '' but he never get any further , for the Jackal recognize he voice at once , and cry : `` Hullo ! you have turn yourself inside out , have you ? just you come out of that ! '' Whereupon he tear open Drumikin and gobble up Lambikin .
