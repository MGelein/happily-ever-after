99 the spirit in the Bottle BrothersS Grimm there be once a poor woodcutter who toil from early morning till late night . when at last he have lay by some money he say to he boy , `` you be my only child , I will spend the money which I have earn with the sweat of my brow on you education ; if you learn some honest trade you can support I in my old age , when my limb have grow stiff and I be oblige to stay at home . '' then the boy go to a High School and learn diligently so that he master praise he , and he remain there a long time . when he have work through two class , but be still not yet perfect in everything , the little pittance which the father have earn be all spend , and the boy be oblige to return home to he . `` ah , '' say the father , sorrowfully , `` I can give you no more , and in these hard time I can not earn a farthing more than will suffice for we daily bread . '' `` dear father , '' answer the son , `` do not trouble yourself about it , if it be God 's will , it will turn to my advantage I shall soon accustom myself to it . '' when the father want to go into the forest to earn money by help to pile and stack wood an also chop it , the son say , `` I will go with you and help you . '' `` Nay , my son , '' say the father , `` that would be hard for you ; you be not accustom to rough work , and will not be able to bear it , besides I have only one axe and no money leave wherewith to buy another . '' `` just go to the neighbor , '' answer the son , `` he will lend you he axe until I have earn one for myself . '' the father then borrow a axe of the neighbor , and next morning at break of day they go out into the forest together . the son help he father and be quite merry and brisk about it . but when the sun be right over they head , the father say , `` we will rest , and have we dinner , and then we shall work as well again . '' the son take he bread in he hand , and say , `` just you rest , father , I be not tire ; I will walk up and down a little in the forest , and look for bird ' nest . '' `` oh , you fool , '' say the father , `` why should you want to run about there ? afterwards you will be tire , and no longer able to raise you arm ; stay here , and sit down beside I . '' the son , however , go into the forest , eat he bread , be very merry and peer in among the green branch to see if he could discover a bird 's nest anywhere . so he go up and down to see if he could find a bird 's nest until at last he come to a great dangerous-looking oak , which certainly be already many hundred year old , and which five man could not have span . he stand still and look at it , and think , `` many a bird must have build its nest in that . '' then all at once it seem to he that he hear a voice . he listen and become aware that someone be cry in a very smother voice , `` let I out , let I out ! '' he look around , but could discover nothing ; nevertheless , he fancy that the voice come out of the ground . then he cry , `` where art thou ? '' the voice answer , `` I be down here amongst the root of the oak-tree . let I out ! let I out ! '' the scholar begin to loosen the earth under the tree , and search among the root , until at last he find a glass bottle in a little hollow . he lift it up and hold it against the light , and then see a creature shape like a frog , spring up and down in it . `` let I out ! let I out ! '' it cry anew , and the scholar think no evil , draw the cork out of the bottle . immediately a spirit ascend from it , and begin to grow , and grow so fast that in a very few moment he stand before the scholar , a terrible fellow as big as half the tree by which he be stand . `` knowest thou , '' he cry in a awful voice , `` what thy wages be for have let I out ? '' `` no , '' reply the scholar fearlessly , `` how should I know that ? '' `` then I will tell thee , '' cry the spirit ; `` I must strangle thee for it . '' `` Thou shouldst have tell I that sooner , '' say the scholar , `` for I should then have leave thee shut up , but my head shall stand fast for all thou canst do ; more person than one must be consult about that . '' `` more person here , more person there , '' say the spirit . `` Thou shalt have the wages thou hast earn . Dost thou think that I be shut up there for such a long time as a favor . no , it be a punishment for I . I be the mighty Mercurius . Whoso release I , he must I strangle . '' `` softly , '' answer the scholar , `` not so fast . I must first know that thou really wert shut up in that little bottle , and that thou art the right spirit . if , indeed , thou canst get in again , I will believe and then thou mayst do as thou wilt with I . '' the spirit say haughtily , `` that be a very trifling feat , '' draw himself together , and make himself as small and slender as he have be at first , so that he creep through the same opening , and right through the neck of the bottle in again . scarcely be he within than the scholar thrust the cork he have draw back into the bottle , and throw it among the root of the oak into its old place , and the spirit be betray . and now the scolar be about to return to he father , but the spirit cry very piteously , `` ah , do let I out ! ah , do let I out ! '' `` no , '' answer the scholar , `` not a second time ! he who have once try to take my life shall not be set free by I , now that I have catch he again . '' `` if thou wilt set I free , '' say the spirit , `` I will give thee so much that thou wilt have plenty all the day of thy life . '' `` no , '' answer the boy , `` thou wouldst cheat I as thou do the first time . '' `` Thou art play away with thy own good luck , '' say the spirit ; `` I will do thee no harm but will reward thee richly . '' the scholar thought , `` I will venture it , perhaps he will keep he word , and anyhow he shall not get the better of I . '' then he take out the cork , and the spirit rise up from the bottle as he have do before , stretch himself out and become as big as a giant . `` now thou shalt have thy reward , '' say he , and hand the scholar a little bag just like a plaster , and say , `` if thou spreadest one end of this over a wound it will heal , and if thou rubbest steel or iron with the other end it will be change into silver . '' `` I must just try that , '' say the scholar , and go to a tree , tear off the bark with he axe , and rub it with one end of the plaster . it immediately close together and be heal . `` now , it be all right , '' he say to the spirit , `` and we can part . '' the spirit thank he for he release , and the boy thank the spirit for he present , and go back to he father . `` where hast thou be race about ? '' say the father ; `` why hast thou forget thy work ? I say at once that thou wouldst never get on with anything . '' `` be easy , father , I will make it up . '' `` make it up indeed , '' say the father angrily , `` there be no art in that . '' `` take care , father , I will soon hew that tree there , so that it will split . '' then he take he plaster , rub the axe with it , and deal a mighty blow , but as the iron have change into silver , the edge turn ; `` Hollo , father , just look what a bad axe you have give I , it have become quite crooked . '' the father be shock and say , `` ah , what hast thou do ? now I shall have to pay for that , and have not the wherewithal , and that be all the good I have get by thy work . '' `` do not get angry , '' say the son , `` I will soon pay for the axe . '' `` oh , thou blockhead , '' cry the father , `` wherewith wilt thou pay for it ? Thou hast nothing but what I give thee . these be student ' trick that be stick in thy head , but thou hast no idea of wood-cutting . '' after a while the scholar say , `` Father , I can really work no more , we have better take a holiday . '' `` Eh , what ! '' answer he , `` dost thou think I will sit with my hand lie in my lap like thee ? I must go on working , but thou mayst take thyself off home . '' `` Father , I be here in this wood for the first time , I do not know my way alone . do go with I . '' as he anger have now abate , the father at last let himself be persuade and go home with he . then he say to the son , `` go and sell thy damage axe , and see what thou canst get for it , and I must earn the difference , in order to pay the neighbor . '' the son take the axe , and carry it into town to a goldsmith , who test it , lay it in the scale , and say , `` it be worth four hundred thaler , I have not so much as that by I . '' the son say , `` give I what thou hast , I will lend you the rest . '' the goldsmith give he three hundred thaler , and remain a hundred in he debt . the son thereupon go home and say , `` Father , I have get the money , go and ask the neighbor what he want for the axe . '' `` I know that already , '' answer the old man , `` one thaler , six groschen . '' `` then give he he two thaler , twelve groschen , that be double and enough ; see , I have money in plenty , '' and he give the father a hundred thaler , and say , `` you shall never know want , live as comfortably as you like . '' `` good heaven ! '' say the father , `` how hast thou come by these riches ? '' the scholar then tell how all have come to pass , and how he , trust in he luck , have make such a good hit . but with the money that be leave , he go back to the High School and go on learn more , and as he could heal all wound with he plaster , he become the most famous doctor in the whole world .
