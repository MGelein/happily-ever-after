THE INDISCREET CONFESSIONSS La Fontain FAMED Paris ne'er within its walls had got , Such magick charms as were Aminta 's lot , Youth , beauty , temper , fortune , she possessed , And all that should a husband render blessed , The mother still retained her ` neath the wing ; Her father 's riches well might lovers bring ; Whate'er his daughter wished , he would provide , Amusements , jewels , dress , and much beside . BLITHE Damon for her having felt the dart , The belle received the offer of his heart ; So well he managed and expressed his flame . That soon her lord and master he became , By Hymen 's right divine , you may conceive , And nothing short of it you should believe . A YEAR had passed , and still our charming pair , Were always pleased , and blisses seemed to share ; -LRB-B- The honeymoon appeared but just began -RRB-B- And hopes were entertained to have a son , When Damon on the subject chanced to touch : In truth , said he , my soul is troubled much ; There is a fact , my dear , to you I 'll tell : I wish sincerely -LRB-B- since I love so well -RRB-B- That for another , I had never known Such fond affection as to you I 've shown ; And none but you had entered in my breast , So worthy ev ` ry way to be caressed . I have howe'er experienced other flame ; The fault 's acknowledged : I confess my shame . 'Twas in a wood ; the nymph was young and nice , And Cupid only near to give advice ; So well he managed : -- or so ill , you 'll say ; A little girl I 've living at this day . WHAT , cried Aminta , now to you I 'll state ; What happened once to be your spouse 's fate ; I was at home alone , to say the truth , When thither came by chance a sprightly youth . The lad was handsome , with engaging mien ; I felt his worth : -- my nature is serene ; In short so many things were our employ , I 've still upon my hands a little boy . THESE words no sooner had escaped the belle , Than Damon into jealous torments fell ; With rage he left the room ; and on his way , A large pack-saddle near his footsteps lay , Which on his back he put , then cried aloud , I 'm saddled ! see ; round quickly came a crowd ; The father , mother , all the servants ran ; The neighbors too ; the husband then began To state the circumstance that gave him pain ; And fully all the folly to explain . THE reader must not fail to keep in mind ; Aminta 's parents were both rich and kind , And having only her to be their heir , The aged couple let the youthful pair , With all their train , within the house reside , And tranquilly the moments seemed to glide . THU mother fondly to her daughter flew ; The father followed , keeping her in view ; The dame went in , but he remained without : To listen he designed beyond a doubt ; The door was on the jar ; the sage drew near ; In short , to all they said , he lent an ear ; The lady thus he heard reproach her child : You 're clearly wrong ; most silly may be styled ; I 've many simpletons and ninnies seen ; But such as you before there ne'er has been : Who 'd have believed you indiscreet like this ? Who forced you to reveal what was amiss ? What obligation to divulge the fact ? More girls than one have failed to be exact ; The Devil 's crafty ; folks are wicked too ; But that is no excuse , however true ; In convents all of us should be immured , Till perfectly by Hymen 's bands secured . E ` EN I who speak , alas ! have troubles met ; Within my bosom oft I feel regret ; Three children ere my marriage I had got ; Have I your father told this secret blot ? Have we together been less happy found ? The list ` ner had no sooner heard the sound , But like a man distracted off he flew ; The saddle 's girth , which hazard near him threw ; He took and fastened tightly ` bout his waist , Then bawled around and round with anxious haste ; I 'm girth 'd ! d'ye see , completely taken in ; The people stared , an ` gan to laugh and grin . Though each was conscious , if the truth were known ; The ridicule in turn might be his own . BOTH husbands madly ran from cross to square , And with their foolish clamors rent the air ; I 'm saddled , hooted one ; I 'm girth 'd , said this ; The latter some perhaps will doubt , and hiss ; Such things however should not be disbelieved For instance , recollect -LRB-B- what 's well received -RRB-B- , When Roland learned the pleasures and the charms ; His rival , in the grot , had in his arms , With fist he gave his horse so hard a blow , It sunk at once to realms of poignant woe . Might he not , training , round the hapless beast , From weight of saddle have its back released , And putting it upon his own , have cried , I 'm saddled , I 'm girth 'd , and much beside ; -LRB-B- No matter this or that , since each is good , -RRB-B- Which Echo would repeat from hill to wood ? You see that truth may be discovered here ; That 's not enough ; its object should appear ; And that I 'll show as further we proceed ; Your full attention I of course shall need . THE happy Damon clearly seems to me , As poor a thing as any we shall see ; His confidence would soon have spoiled the whole , To leave a belle like this without control ! Her simplicity I much admire : -- Confess herself to spouse , as if a friar ! What silliness ! imprudence is a word , Which here to use would truly be absurd . To my discourse two heads alone remain ; The marriage vow you always should maintain ; Its faith the pair should ever keep in view : The path of honor steadily pursue . If some mishap howe'er should chance to glide ; And make you limp on one or t ` other side , Endeavour , of the fault , to make the best , And keep the secret locked within your breast ; Your own consideration never lose ; Untruth ` tis pardonable then to use . No doubt my pages nice advice supply ; Is ` t what I 've followed ? -- No , you may rely !
