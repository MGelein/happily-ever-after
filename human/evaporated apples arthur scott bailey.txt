EVAPORATED APPLES Arthur Scott Bailey Now , evaporated apples are nothing more or less than dried apples . The cook of the loggers ' camp used them to make apple pies . And first , before making his pies , he always soaked them in water so they would swell . Now you see what made Fatty Coon feel so queer and uncomfortable . He had first eaten his dried apples . And then he had soaked them , by drinking out of the brook . It was no wonder that his sides stuck out , for the apples that he had bolted were swelling and puffing him out until he felt that he should burst . In fact , the wonder of it was that he was able to get through his mother 's doorway , when he reached home . But he did it , though it cost him a few groans . And he frightened his mother , too . `` I only hope you 're not poisoned , '' she said , when Fatty told her what he had been doing . And that remark frightened Fatty more than ever . He was sure he was never going to feel any better . Poor Mrs. Coon was much worried all the rest of the night . But when morning came she knew that Fatty was out of danger . She knew it because of something he said . It was this : `` Oh , dear ! I wish I had something to eat ! ''
