THE CRADLE La Fontain NEAR Rome , of yore , close to the Florence road , Was seen a humble innkeeper 's abode ; Small sums were charged ; few guests the night would stay ; And these could seldom much afford to pay . A pleasing active partner had the host Her age not much ` bove thirty at the most ; Two children she her loving husband bore ; The boy was one year old : the daughter more ; Just fifteen summers o ` er her form had smiled ; In person charming , and in temper mild . IT happened that Pinucio , young and gay , A youth of family , oft passed the way , Admired the girl , and thought she might be gained , Attentions showed , and like return obtained ; The mistress was not deaf , nor lover mute ; Pinucio seemed the lady 's taste to suit , Of pleasing person and engaging air ; And ` mong the equals of our youthful fair , As yet , not one a pref ` rence had received ; Nor had she e ` er in golden dreams believed ; But , spite of tender years , her mind was high , And village lads she would not let come nigh . COLUTTA , -LRB-B- such her name , -RRB-B- though much admired ; And many in the place her hand desired , Rejected some , and others would not take , And this most clearly for Pinucio 's sake . Long conversations she could rarely get , And various obstacles the lovers met ; No interviews where they might be at ease , But ev ` ry thing conspired to fret and teaze . O parents , husbands ! be advised by me ; Constraint with wives or children wo n't agree ; ` Tis then the god of love exerts his art , To find admittance to the throbbing heart . PINUCIO and a friend , one stormy night , The landlord 's reached and would in haste alight ; They asked for beds , but were too late they found : You know , sir , cried the host , we do n't abound ; And now the very garrets we have let : You 'd better elsewhere try your wish to get , And spite of weather , further on pursue At best , our lodging is unfit for you . HAVE you no truckle bed ? the lover cried ; No corner left ? -- we fain would here abide : Why , truly , said the host , we always keep Two beds within the chamber where we sleep ; My wife and I , of course , take one of these ; Together lie in t ` other if you please . The spark replied , this we will gladly do ; Come , supper get ; that o ` er , the friends withdrew : Pinucio , by Coletta 's sage advice , In looking o ` er the room was very nice ; With eagle-eyes particulars he traced , Then ` tween the clothes himself and friend he placed . A camp-bed for the girl was on the floor ; The landlord 's , ` gainst the wall and next the door ; Another opposite the last was set , And this , to guests , at certain times was let ; And ` tween the two , but near the parents ' best , A cradle for the child to rest its head , From which a pleasant accident arrived , That our gallant 's young friend of rest deprived . WHEN midnight came , and this gay spark supposed The host and hostess ' eyes in sleep were closed , Convinced the time appointed was at hand , To put in execution what was planned , He to the camp-bed silently repaired , And found the belle by Morpheus not insnared ; Coletta taught a play that mortals find Fatigues the body more than plagues the mind : A truce succeeded , but 'twas quickly o ` er : Those rest not long who pilfer Cupid 's store . AGAIN , when to the room the hostess came , And found the cradle rested not the same , Good heav ` ns ! cried she , it joins my husband 's head : And , but for that , I truly had been led To lay myself unthinkingly beside The strangers whom with lodging we provide ; But , God be praised , this cradle shows the place Where my good husband 's pillow I must trace . This said , she with the friend was quickly laid , Without suspecting what mistake she 'd made . BETWEEN the lovers all was blithe and gay , When suddenly the friend , though far from day , Was forced to rise -LRB-B- 'twas plain a pressing case , -RRB-B- And move the infant 's cradle from its place , To ope the door , and lest he noise might make , Or any way by chance the child should wake , He set it carefully beside his bed , And -LRB-B- softly treading -RRB-B- to the garden sped . ON his return he passed the cradle by ; To place it as before he would not try , But went to sleep ; when presently a sound , From something that had tumbled , rang around , Awoke his wife , who ran below , That what had happened she might clearly know . No fool in such adventures was our Wight : The opportunity he would not slight , But played the husband well : no , no , I 'm wrong ; He played it ill : -- too oft , too much , too long ; For whosoe'er would wish to do it well , Should softly go : -- the gentle most excel . IN truth , the wife was quite surprised to find Her spouse so much to frolicking inclined ; Said she , what ails the man , he 's grown so gay ? A lad of twenty 's not more fond of play . Well ! let 's enjoy the moments while we can ; God 's will be done , since life is but a span ! THE words were scarcely said , when our gallant Renewed his fun , and nothing seemed to want ; Indeed , the hostess still her charms possessed , And , on occasion , well might be caressed . MEANWHILE Coletta , dreading a surprise , Prevailed upon her paramor to rise ; 'Twas nearly break of day when he withdrew , But , groping to his place the way anew , Pinucio , by the cradle too , was led To miss his friend 's and take the landlord 's bed . No sooner in than with an under voice , -LRB-B- Intriguers oft too eagerly rejoice , -RRB-B- Said he , my friend , I wish I could relate The pleasure I 've received ; my bliss is great ; To you , I 'm sorry , Fortune proves so cold ; Like happiness I 'd fain in you behold ; Coletta is a morsel for a king ; Inestimable girl ! -- to me she 'll cling . I 've many seen , but such a charming fair , There 's not another like her any where . WITH softest skin , delightful form and mien ; Her ev ` ry act resembles BEAUTY 's queen ; In short , before we 'd ended with our fun , Six posts -LRB-B- without a fiction -RRB-B- we had run . The host was struck with what the spark averred , And muttered something indistinctly heard . THE hostess whispered HIM she thought her spouse : -- Again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house ; Pray do n't you hear how they together chat ? -- Just then the husband raised himself and sat ; Is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage ; Was it for THIS you would my house engage ? You understand me , but I 'll seek redress ; Think you so very cheap to have success ? What , would you ruin families at will , And with our daughters take at ease your fill ? Away , I say ! my house this moment quit ; And as for You , abominable chit , I 'll have your life : this hour you breathe your last ; Such creatures only can with beasts be classed . PINUCIO heard the lecture with dismay , At once was mute , and grew as cold as clay ; A moment 's silence through the room prevailed ; Coletta trembled , and her lot bewailed . The hostess now , on ev ` ry side perceived Her peril great , and for the error grieved . The friend , howe'er , the cradle called to mind , Which caused the many ills we 've seen combined , And instantly he cried : -- Pinucio ! strange You thus allow yourself about to range ; Did I not tell you when the wine you took , ` Twould make many sad misfortunes hook ? Whene'er you freely drink , ` tis known fall well , Your sleep 's disturbed , you walk , and nonsense tell . Come , come to bed : the morning soon will peep ; Pinucio took the hint , pretended sleep , And carried on so artfully the wile , The husband no suspicion had of guile . The stratagem our hostess likewise tried , And to her daughter 's bed in silence hied , Where she conceived her fortress was so strong , She presently began to use her tongue , And cried aloud : -- Impossible the fact ; Such things he could not with Coletta act ; I 've with her been in bed throughout the night , And she , no more than I , has swerved from right ; ` Twere mighty pretty , truly , here to come ; At this the host a little while was dumb ; But in a lower tone at length replied I nought with your account I 'm satisfied . THE party rose ; the titter circled round ; And each sufficient reason for it found ; The whole was secret , and whoe'er had gained , With care upon the subject mute remained .
