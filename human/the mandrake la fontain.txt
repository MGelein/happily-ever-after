THE MANDRAKE La Fontain FLORENTINE we now design to show ; -- A greater blockhead ne'er appeared below ; It seems a prudent woman he had wed , With beauty that might grace a monarch 's bed ; Young , brisk , good-humoured , with engaging mien ; None in the town , or round , the like was seen : Her praises every voice inclined to sing , And judged her worthy of a mighty king ; At least a better husband she deserved : An arrant fool he looked , and quite unnerved . This Nicia Calfucci -LRB-B- for such his name -RRB-B- Was fully bent to have a father 's fame , And thought his country honor he could do , Could he contrive his lineage to pursue . No holy saint in Paradise was blessed , But what this husband fervently addressed ; From day to day , so oft he teazed for grace , They scarcely knew his off ` rings where to place . No matron , quack , nor conjurer around , But what he tried their qualities profound ; Yet all in vain : in spite of charm or book , No father he , whatever pains he took . TO Florence then returned a youth from France ; Where he had studied , -- more than complaisance : Well trained as any from that polished court ; To Fortune 's favors anxious to resort ; Gallant and seeking ev ` ry FAIR to please ; Each house , road , alley , soon he knew at ease ; The husbands , good or bad , their whims and years , With ev ` ry thing that moved their hopes or fears ; What sort of fuel best their females charmed ; What spies were kept by those who felt alarmed ; The if 's , for 's , to 's , and ev ` ry artful wile , That might in love a confidant beguile , Or nurse , or father-confessor , or dog ; When passion prompts , few obstacles can clog . THE snares were spread , each stratagem was laid ; And every thing arranged to furnish aid , When our gay spark determined to invest Old Nicia with the cuckold 's branching crest . The plan no doubt was well conceived and bold ; The lady to her friends appeared not cold ; Within her husband 's house she seemed polite ; But ne'er familiarly was seen invite , No further could a lover dare proceed ; Not one had hope the belle his flame would heed . OUR youth , Calimachus , no sooner came , But he howe'er appeared to please the dame ; His camp he pitched and entered on the siege Of fair Lucretia , faithful to her liege , Who presently the haughty tigress played , And sent him , like the rest , away dismayed . HE , scarcely knew what saint he could invoke ; When Nicia 's folly served him for a cloak ; However strange , no stratagem nor snare , But what the fool would willingly prepare With all his heart , and nothing fancy wrong ; That might to others possibly belong . The lover and himself , as learned men , Had conversations ev ` ry now and then ; For Nicia was a doctor in the law : Degree , to him , not worth a single straw ; Far better had he common prudence traced ; And not his confidence so badly placed . ONE day he to Calimachus complained , Of want of heirs , and wished they could be gained : Where lay the fault ? He was a gay gallant ; Lucretia young with features to enchant . When I at Paris was , replied our wight , There passed a clever man , a curious sight , His company with anxious care I sought , And was at length a hundred secrets taught ; ` Mong others how , at will , to get an heir : -- A certain thing , he often would declare ; The great Mogul had tried it on his queen , just two years since , the heir might then be seen ; And many other princesses of fame , Had added by it to their husband 's name . 'Twas very true ; I 've seen it fully proved : The remedy all obstacles removed ; ` Tis from the root of certain tree expressed ; A juice most potent ev ` ry where confessed , And Mandrake called , which taken by a wife ; More pow ` r evinces o ` er organick life , Than from conventual grace was e ` er derived , Though in the cloister youthful friars hived . TEN months from hence I 'll you a father make ; No longer time than that I ask to take ; This period o ` er , the child to church we 'll bring , -- If true , said Nicia , what a glorious thing ! You 'll do me services I ca n't express . -- Do n't doubt it , cried the spark of smart address : Must I the fact so oft to you repeat ? I 've seen it with my eyes ; ` tis most complete ; You mean to jest , assuredly my friend ; Would you by doubts the great Mogul offend ? So handsomely this traveller he paid , No sign of discontent he e ` er betrayed . ` TIS excellent , the Florentine replied ; Lucretia must be pleased to have it tried ; What satisfaction ! in her arms to view An infant that my lineage will renew . Now , worthy friend , you god-father shall stand ; This very day pray take the thing in hand . NOT quite so fast , rejoined our smart gallant , First know the plan , before consent you grant ; There is an ill attends the whole affair ; But what below , alas ! is free from care ; This juice , possessing virtues so divine , Has also pow ` rs that prove the most malign : Whoe'er receives the patient 's first embrace ; Too fatally the dire effects will trace ; Death oft succeeds the momentary joy ; We scarcely good can find without alloy . YOUR servant ; sir , said Nicia with surprise ; No more of this : the name will me suffice ; Lucretia we will let remain at ease : What you propose can never truly please ; If I must die by getting of a son , ` Tis better far the benefit to shun ; Go find some other for your wondrous art ; In fact I 'm not inclined with life to part . HOW strange your conduct , cried the sprightly youth : Extremes you seek , and overleap the truth ; Just now the fond desire to have a boy Chased ev ` ry care and filled your heart with joy ; At present quite the contrary appears A moment changed your fondest hopes to fears ; Come , hear the rest ; no longer waste your breath : Kind Nature all can cure , excepting death . What 's necessary pray , that things succeed ? Some youthful clod for once should take the lead , And clear the way of ev ` ry venom round Then you with safety may commence to sound ; No time you 'll lose , but instantly begin And you 'll most certainly your object win . This step is necessary to the end ; Some lad of little worth I recommend ; But not ill made , nor savagely robust , To give your lady terror nor disgust . We know that , used to Nicia 's soft caress , Lucretia would disrelish rude address ; Indeed ` tis possible in such event , Her tender heart would never give consent ; This led me to propose a man that 's young ; Besides , the more he proves for action strong , The less of venom will behind remain , And I 'll engage that ev ` ry drop he 'll drain . AT first the husband disapproved the plan , The infamy , and danger which they ran Perhaps the magistrate might have him sought , And he , of murder , guilty might be thought ; The sudden death would mightily perplex ; A fellow 's creature 's loss would sorely vex ; Lucretia , who 'd withstood each tempter 's charms , Was now to be disgraced in rustick arms ! CALIMACHUS , with eagerness replied ; I would a man of consequence provide , Or one , at all events , whose anxious aim Would be , aloud the myst ` ry , to proclaim ! But fear and folly would contain the clown , Or money at the worst would stop renown , Your better half apparently resigned ; The clod without intention of the kind ; In short whate'er arrived , ` tis clear your case Could not with Cuckoldom be well in place . Besides ` tis no way certain but our blade , By strength of nerves the poison may evade ; And that 's a double reason for the choice , Since with more certainty we shall rejoice : The venom may evaporate in fume , And Mandrake pleasing pow ` rs at once assume ; For when I spoke of death , I did not mean , That nothing from it would the person screen ; To-morrow we the rustick lad must name ; To-night the potion given your charming dame ; I 've some already with me , all prepared ; Let nothing of your project be declared : You should not seem to know what we 've designed ; Ligurio you 'll permit this clod to find ; You can most thoroughly in him confide : Discretion , secrecy , with him reside . One thing , however , nearly I 'd forgot ; A bandage for the eyes we should allot ; And when well bound he nothing e ` er can trace Of whom , or what , the lady , or the place . THE whole arrangement Nicia much approved ; But now 'twas time the lady should be moved . At first she thought it jest , then angry grew , And vowed the plan she never would pursue ; Her life she 'd rather forfeit than her name : Once known , for ever lost would be her fame Besides the heinous sin and vile offence , God knew she rather would with all dispense ; Mere complaisance had led her to comply ; Would she admit a wretch with blearing eye , To incommode , and banish tranquil ease ? Who could conceive her formed a clod to please ? Can I , said she , the paths of honor quit , And in my bed a loathsome brute permit ? Or e ` er regard the plan but with disdain ? No , by saint John , I ever will maintain , Nor beau , nor clown , nor king , nor lord , nor ` squire , Save Nicia , with me freely shall retire . THE fair Lucretia seemed so firmly bent , To father Timothy at length they went , Who preached the lady such a fine discourse , She ceded more through penitence than force . MOREOVER she was promised that the lad Should be nor clownish , nor in person bad ; Nor such as any way might give disgust , But one to whom she perfectly might trust . THE wondrous draught was taken by the fair ; Next day our Wight prepared his wily snare : Himself bepowdered like a miller 's man , With beard and whiskers to complete his plan ; A better metamorphose ne'er was seen ; Ligurio , who had in the secret been , So thoroughly disguised the lover thought , At midnight him to Nicia freely brought , With bandage o ` er the eyes and hair disdained , Not once the husband of deceit complained . BESIDE the dame in silence slid our spark ; In silence she attended in the dark , Perfumed and nicely ev ` ry way bedecked ; For what ? you ask , or whom did she expect ; Were all these pains a miller to receive ? -- Too much they can not take , the sex believe ; And whether kings or millers be their aim , The wish to please is ever found the same . ` Tis double honor in a woman thought , When by her charms a torpid heart is caught ; She , who in icy bosoms flame can raise , Deserving doubtless is of treble praise . THE spark disguised , his place no sooner took , But awkwardness he presently forsook ; No more the miller , but the smart gallant : The lady found him kind and complaisant ; Such moments we 'll suppose were well employed ; Though trembling fears not perfectly destroyed . SHE , to herself , remarked , ` tis very strange , This lad 's demeanor should so quickly change ; He 's quite another character , ` tis clear ; What pity that his end should be so near ; Alas ! he merits not so hard a fate ; I feel regret the lot should him await ; And while soft pleasure seems his heart 's delight ; His soul is doomed from hence to take its flight . THE husband who so fully gave consent , Was led his partner 's suff ` rings to lament The spirit of a queen in truth she showed , When cuckoldom was on her spouse bestowed ; In decoration , forced to acquiesce , She would not condescend to join caress . LUCRETIA howsoe'er the lad approved ; His winning manners much her favor moved . WHEN he the subtle venom had subdued , He took her hand , and having fondly sued , Said he , your pardon lady now I ask ; Be not displeased when I remove the mask ; Your rage restrain ; a trick on you 's been played ; Calimachus am I ; be not dismayed ; Approve my sacrifice ; the secret 's known ; Your rigor would be useless now if shown ; Should I be doomed howe'er to breathe my last , I die content , rememb ` ring what has passed ; You have the means my life at will to take ; More havock with me soft delight could make , Than any poison that the draught possessed ; Mere folly , imposition , all the rest . TILL then Lucretia had resistance made ; To seem submissive she was still afraid ; The lover was not hated by the belle , But bashfulness she could not well dispel , Which , joined to simple manners mixed with fear , Ungrateful made her , spite of self , appear . IN silence wrapt , and scarcely drawing breath , By passion moved , and yet ashamed to death , Not knowing how to act , so great her grief , From tears , her throbbing bosom sought relief . Look , could she e ` er her lover in the face ? Will he not think me covered with disgrace ? Said she , within herself ; -- what else believe ? My wits were lost to let him thus deceive . O'ercome by sorrow , then she turned her head , And tried to hide herself within the bed , At furthest end , but vain alas her aim , The lover thither in a moment came : Her only ground , remaining unsubdued , Surrendered when the vanquisher pursued , Who every thing submitted to his will , And tears no more her eyes were found to fill ; Shame took to flight , and scruples spread the wing ; How happy those whom duping GAIN can bring ! TOO soon Aurora for our spark appeared ; Too soon for her so thoroughly revered ; Said he , the poison , that can life devour , Requires repeated acts to crush its pow ` r. The foll ` wing days our youthful am ` rous pair Found opportunities for pleasing fare . The husband scarcely could himself contain , So anxiously he wished his aim to gain . THE lover from the belle at length arose , And hastened to his house to seek repose ; But scarcely had he placed himself in bed , When our good husband 's footsteps thither led ; He , to the spark , related with delight , How mandrake-juice succeeded in the night . Said he , at first beside the bed I crept , And listened if the miller near her kept , Or whether he to converse was inclined , And ev ` ry way to act as was designed . I then my wife was anxious to address , And whispered that she should the youth caress ; Nor dread too much the spoiling of her charms : Indeed 'twas all embarrassing alarms . Do n't think , said I , that either can deceive ; I ev ` ry thing shall hear , you may believe ; Know , Nicia is a man , who well may say , He 's trusted without measure ev ` ry day . PRAY recollect my very life 's at stake , And do not many difficulties make . Convince thereby how much your spouse you love ; ` Twill pleasure doubtless give the pow ` rs above . But should the blockhead any how prove shy Send instantly to me ; I shall be nigh ; I 'm going now to rest ; by no means fail ; We 'll soon contrive and ev ` ry way prevail . But there was no necessity for this ; ` Tis pretty clear that nothing went amiss . In fact the rustick liked the business well , And seemed unwilling to resign the belle , I pity him , and much lament his lot ; But -- he must die and soon will be forgot : A fig for those who used to crack their jest ; In nine months ' time a child will be the test .
