THE LITTLE DOG La Fontain THE key , which opes the chest of hoarded gold . Unlocks the heart that favors would withhold . To this the god of love has oft recourse , When arrows fail to reach the secret source , And I 'll maintain he 's right , for , ` mong mankind , Nice presents ev ` ry where we pleasing find ; KingsS , princes , potentates , receive the same , And when a lady thinks she 's not to blame , To do what custom tolerates around ; When Venus ' acts are only ThemisS ' found , I 'll nothing ` gainst her say ; more faults than one , Besides the present , have their course begun . A MANTUAN judge espoused a beauteous fair : Her name was Argia : -- Anselm was her care , An aged dotard , trembling with alarms , While she was young , and blessed with seraph charms . But , not content with such a pleasing prize , His jealousy appeared without disguise , Which greater admiration round her drew , Who doubtless merited , in ev ` ry view , Attention from the first in rank or place So elegant her form , so fine her face . ` TWOULD endless prove , and nothing would avail , Each lover 's pain minutely to detail : Their arts and wiles ; enough ` twill be no doubt , To say the lady 's heart was found so stout , She let them sigh their precious hours away , And scarcely seemed emotion to betray . WHILE at the judge 's , Cupid was employed , Some weighty things the Mantuan state annoyed , Of such importance , that the rulers meant , An embassy should to the Pope be sent . As Anselm was a judge of high degree , No one so well embassador could be . 'TWAS with reluctance he agreed to go , And be at Rome their mighty Plenipo ' ; The business would be long , and he must dwell Six months or more abroad , he could not tell . Though great the honor , he should leave his dove , Which would be painful to connubial love . Long embassies and journeys far from home Oft cuckoldom around induce to roam . THE husband , full of fears about his wife ; Exclaimed -- my ever -- darling , precious life , I must away ; adieu , be faithful pray , To one whose heart from you can never stray But swear to me , my duck , -LRB-B- for , truth to tell , I 've reason to be jealous of my belle , -RRB-B- Now swear these sparks , whose ardor I perceive , Have sighed without success , and I 'll believe . But still your honor better to secure , From slander 's tongue , and virtue to ensure , I 'd have you to our country-house repair ; The city quit : -- these sly gallants beware ; Their presents too , accurst invention found , With danger fraught , and ever much renowned ; For always in the world , where lovers move , These gifts the parent of assentment prove . ` Gainst those declare at once ; nor lend an ear To flattery , their cunning sister-peer . If they approach , shut straight both ears and eyes ; For nothing you shall want that wealth supplies ; My store you may command ; the key behold , Where I 've deposited my notes and gold . Receive my rents ; expend whate'er you please ; I 'll look for no accounts ; live quite at ease ; I shall be satisfied with what you do , If naught therein to raise a blush I view ; You 've full permission to amuse your mind ; Your love , howe'er , for me alone 's designed ; That , recollect , must be for my return , For which our bosoms will with ardor burn . THE good man 's bounty seemingly was sweet ; All pleasures , one excepted , she might greet ; But that , alas ! by bosoms unpossessed , No happiness arises from the rest : His lady promised ev ` ry thing required : -- Deaf , blind , and cruel , -- whosoe'er admired ; And not a present would her hand receive At his return , he fully might believe , She would be found the same as when he went , Without gallant , or aught to discontent . HER husband gone , she presently retired Where Anselm had so earnestly desired ; The lovers came , but they were soon dismissed , And told , from visits they must all desist ; Their assiduities were irksome grown , And she was weary of their lovesick tone . Save one , they all were odious to the fair ; A handsome youth , with smart engaging air ; But whose attentions to the belle were vain ; In spite of arts , his aim he could not gain ; His name was Atis , known to love and arms , Who grudged no pains , could he possess her charms . Each wile he tried , and if he 'd kept to sighs , No doubt the source is one that never dries ; But often diff ` rent with expense ` tis found ; His wealth was wasted rapidly around He wretched grew ; at length for debt he fled , And sought a desert to conceal his head . As on the road he moved , a clown he met , Who with his stick an adder tried to get , From out a thicket , where it hissing lay , And hoped to drive the countryman away : Our knight his object asked ; the clown replied , To slay the reptile anxiously I tried ; Wherever met , an adder I would kill : The race should be extinct if I 'd my will . WHY would ` st thou , friend , said Atis , these destroy ? God meant that all should freely life enjoy . The youthful knight for reptiles had , we find , Less dread than what prevails with human kind ; He bore them in his arms : -- they marked his birth ; From noble Cadmus sprung , who , when on earth , At last , to serpent was in age transformed ; The adder 's bush the clown no longer stormed ; No more the spotted reptile sought to stay , But seized the time , and quickly crept away . AT length our lover to a wood retired ; To live concealed was what the youth desired ; Lorn silence reigned , except from birds that sang , And dells that oft with sweetest echo rang . There HAPPINESS and frightful MIS ` RY lay , Quite undistinguished : classed with beasts of prey ; That growling prowled in search of food around : There Atis consolation never found . LOVE thither followed , and , however viewed , 'Twas vain to hope his passion to elude ; Retirement fed the tender , ardent flame , And irksome ev ` ry minute soon became . Let us return , cried he , since such our fate : ` Tis better , Atis , bear her frowns and hate , Than of her beauteous features lose the view ; Ye nightingales and streams , ye woods adieu ! When far from her I neither see nor hear : ` Tis she alone my senses still revere ; A slave I am , who fled her dire disdain ; Yet seek once more to wear the cruel chain . AS near some noble walls our knight arrived , Which fairy-hands to raise had once contrived , His eyes beheld , at peep of early morn , When bright Aurora 's beams the earth adorn , A beauteous nymph in royal robes attired , Of noble mien , and formed to be admired , Who t ` ward him drew , with pleasing , gracious air , While he was wrapped in thought , a prey to care . SAID she , I 'd have you , Atis , happy be ; ` Tis in my pow ` r , and this I hope to see ; A fairy greet me , Manto is my name : -- Your friend , and one you 've served unknown : -- the same My fame you 've heard , no doubt ; from me proceeds The Mantuan town , renowned for ancient deeds ; In days of yore I these foundations laid , Which in duration , equal I have made , To those of Memphis , where the Nile 's proud course Majestically flows from hidden source . The cruel Parcae are to us unknown ; We wond ` rous magick pow ` rs have often shown ; But wretched , spite of this , appears our lot Death never comes , though various ills we 've got , For we to human maladies are prone , And suffer greatly oft , I freely own . ONCE , in each week to serpents we are changed ; Do you remember how you here arranged , To save an adder from a clown 's attack ? 'Twas I , the furious rustick wished to hack , When you assisted me to get away ; For recompense , my friend , without delay , I 'll you procure the kindness of the fair , Who makes you love and drives you to despair : We 'll go and see her : -- be assured from me , Before two days are passed , as I foresee , You 'll gain , by presents , Argia and the rest , Who round her watch , and are the suitor 's pest . Grudge no expense , be gen ` rous , and be bold , Your handfuls scatter , lavish be of gold . Assured you shall not want the precious ore ; For I command the whole of Plutus ' store , Preserved , to please me , in the shades below ; This charmer soon our magick pow ` r shall know . THE better to approach the cruel belle , And to your suit her prompt consent compel , Myself transformed you 'll presently perceive ; And , as a little dog , I 'll much achieve , Around and round I 'll gambol o ` er the lawn , And ev ` ry way attempt to please and fawn , While you , a pilgrim , shall the bag-pipe play ; Come , bring me to the dame without delay . NO sooner said , the lover quickly changed , Together with the fairy , as arranged ; A pilgrim he , like Orpheus , piped and sang ; While Manto , as a dog , skipt , jumped , and sprang . THEY thus proceeded to the beauteous dame ; Soon valets , maids , and others round them came ; The dog and pilgrim gave extreme delight And all were quite diverted at the sight . THE lady heard the noise , and sent her maid , To learn the reason why they romped and played : She soon returned and told the lovely belle , A spaniel danced , and even spoke so well , it ev ` ry thing could fully understand , And showed obedience to the least command . ` Twere better come herself and take a view : The things were wond ` rous that the dog could do . THE dame at any price the dog would buy , In case the master should the boon deny . To give the dog our pilgrim was desired ; But though he would not grant the thing required ; He whispered to the maid the price he 'd take , And some proposals was induced to make . Said he , ` tis true , the creature 's not for sale ; Nor would I give it : prayers will ne'er prevail ; Whate'er I chance to want from day to day , It furnishes without the least delay . To have my wish , three words alone I use , Its paw I squeeze , and whatsoe'er I choose , Of gold , or jewels , fall upon the ground ; Search all the world , there 's nothing like it found . Your lady 's rich , and money does not want ; Howe'er , my little dog to her I 'll grant If she 'll a night permit me in her bed , The treasure shall at once to her be led . THE maid at this proposal felt surprise ; Her mistress truly ! less might well suffice ; A paltry knave ! cried she , it makes me laugh ; What ! take within her bed a pilgrim 's staff ! Were such a circumstance abroad to get , My lady would with ridicule be met ; The dog and master , probably , were last Beneath a hedge , or on a dunghill cast ; A house like this they 'll never see agen ; -- But then the master is the pride of men , And that in love is ev ` ry thing we find Much wealth and beauty please all womankind ! HIS features and his mien the knight had changed ; Each air and look for conquest were arranged . The maid exclaimed : when such a lover sues , How can a woman any thing refuse ? Besides the pilgrim has a dog , ` tis plain , Not all the wealth of China could obtain . Yet to possess my lady for a night , Would to the master be supreme delight : I SHOULD have mentioned , that our cunning spark ; The dog would whisper -LRB-B- feigning some remark , -RRB-B- On which ten ducats tumbled at his feet ; These Atis gave the maid , -LRB-B- O deed discreet ; -RRB-B- Then fell a diamond : this our wily wight Took up , and smiling at the precious sight , Said he , what now I hold I beg you 'll bear , To her you serve , so worthy of your care ; Present my compliments , and to her say , I 'm her devoted servant from to-day . THU female quickly to her mistress went ; Our charming little dog to represent : The various pow ` rs displayed , and wonders done ; Yet scarcely had she on the knight begun , And mentioned what he wished her to unfold , But Argia could her rage no longer hold ; A fellow ! to presume , cried she , to speak Of me with freedom ! -- I am not so weak , To listen to such infamy , not I A pilgrim too ! -- no , you may well rely , E ` en were he Atis , it would be the same , To whom I now my cruel conduct blame : Such things he never would to me propose ; Not e ` en a monarch would the like disclose ; I 'm ` bove temptation , presents would not do : -- Not Plutus ' stores , if offered to my view ; A paltry pilgrim to presume indeed , To think that I would such a blackguard heed , Ambassadress my rank ! and to admit A fellow , only for the gallows fit ! THIS pilgrim , cried the maid , has got the means Not only belles to get , but even queens ; Or beauteous goddesses he could obtain : -- He 's worth a thousand Atis 's ` tis plain . Bur , said the wife , my husband made me vow . What ? cried the maid , you 'd not bedeck his brow ! A pretty promise truly : -- can you think , You less from this , than from the first , should shrink ? Who 'll know the fact , or publish it around ? Consider well , how many might be found , Who , were they marked with spot upon the nose , When things had taken place that we suppose , Would not their heads so very lofty place , I 'm well assured , but feel their own disgrace . For such a thing , are we the worse a hair ? No , no , good lady , who presumes to swear , He can discern the lips which have been pressed , By those that never have the fact confessed , Must be possessed of penetrating eyes , Which pierce the sable veil of dark disguise . This favor , whether you accord or not , ` Twill not a whit be less nor more a blot . For whom , I pray , LOVE 'S treasures would you hoard ? For one , who never will a treat afford , Or what is much the same , has not the pow ` r ? All he may want you 'll give him in an hour , At his return ; he 's very weak and old , And , doubtless , ev ` ry way is icy cold ! THE cunning girl such rhetorick displayed , That all she said , her mistress , having weighed , Began to doubt alone , and not deny The spaniel 's art , and pilgrim 's piercing eye : To her the master and his dog were led , To satisfy her mind while still in bed ; For bright Aurora , from the wat ` ry deep , Not more reluctantly arose from sleep . OUR spark approached the dame with easy air , Which seemed the man of fashion to declare ; His compliments were made with ev ` ry grace , That minds most difficult could wish to trace . THE fair was charmed , and with him quite content ; You do not look , said she , like one who meant Saint James of Compostella soon to see , Though , doubtless , oft to saints you bend the knee . TO entertain the smiling beauteous dame , The dog , by various tricks , confirmed his flame , To please the maid and mistress he 'd in view : Too much for these of course he could not do ; Though , for the husband , he would never move , The little fav ` rite sought again to prove His wond ` rous worth , and scattered o ` er the ground , With sudden shake , among the servants round , Nice pearls , which they on strings arranged with care ; And these the pilgrim offered to the fair : Gallantly fastened them around her arms , Admired their whiteness and extolled her charms : So well he managed , 'twas at length agreed , In what his heart desired he should succeed ; The dog was bought : the belle bestowed a kiss , As earnest of the promised future bliss . THE night arrived , when Atis fondly pressed , Within his arms , the lady thus caressed ; Himself he suddenly became again , On which she scarcely could her joy contain : -- Th ' ambassador she more respect should show , Than favors on a pilgrim to bestow . THE fair and spark so much admired the night ; That others followed equal in delight ; Each felt the same , for where 's the perfect shade ; That can conceal when joys like these pervade ? Expression strongly marks the youthful face , And all that are not blind the truth can trace . Some months had passed , when Anselm was dismissed ; Of gifts and pardons , long appeared his list ; A load of honors from the Pope he got : -- The CHURCH will these most lib ` rally allot . FROM his vicegerent quickly he received A good account , and friends his fears relieved ; The servants never dropt a single word Of what had passed , but all to please concurred . THE judge , both maid and servants , questioned much ; But not a hint he got , their care was such . Yet , as it often happens ` mong the FAIR , The devil entered on a sudden there ; Such quarrels ` tween the maid and mistress rose , The former vowed she would the tale disclose . Revenge induced her ev ` ry thing to tell , Though she were implicated with the belle . SO great the husband 's rage , no words can speak : His fury somewhere he of course would wreak ; But , since to paint it clearly would be vain -- You 'll by the sequel judge his poignant pain . A SERVANT Anselm ordered to convey His wife a note , who was , without delay , To come to town her honored spouse to see ; Extremely ill -LRB-B- for such he feigned to be . -RRB-B- As yet the lady in the country stayed ; Her husband to and fro ' his visits paid . SAID he , remember , when upon the road , Conducting Argia from her lone abode , You must contrive her men to get away , And with her none but you presume to stay . -- A jade ! she horns has planted on my brow : Her death shall be the consequence I vow . WITH force a poinard in her bosom thrust ; Watch well th ' occasion : -- die , I say , she must , The deed performed , escape ; here 's for you aid ; The money take : -- pursuit you can evade ; As I request , proceed ; then trust to me : -- You naught shall want wherever you may be . TO seek fair Argia instantly he went ; She , by her dog , was warned of his intent . How these can warn ? if asked , I shall reply , They grumble , bark , complain , or fawn , or sigh ; Pull petticoat or gown , and snarl at all , Who happen in their way just then to fall ; But few so dull as not to comprehend ; Howe'er , this fav ` rite whispered to his friend , The dangers that awaited her around ; But go , said he , protection you have found ; Confide in me : -- I 'll ev ` ry ill prevent , For which the rascal hither has been sent . As on they moved , a wood was in the way , Where robbers often waited for their prey ; The villain whom the husband had employed , Sent forward those whose company annoyed , And would prevent his execrable plan ; The last of horrid crimes . -- disgrace to man ! No sooner had the wretch his orders told , But Argia vanished -- none could her behold ; The beauteous belle was quickly lost to view : A cloud , the fairy Manto o ` er her threw . THIS circumstance astonished much the wretch , Who ran to give our doating spouse a sketch Of what had passed so strange upon the way ; Old Anselm thither went without delay , When , marvellous to think ! with great surprise , He saw a palace of extensive size , Erected where , an hour or two before , A hovel was not seen , nor e ` en a door . THE husband stood aghast ! -- admired the place , Not built for man , e ` en gods ` twould not disgrace . The rooms were gilt ; the decorations fine ; The gardens and the pleasure-grounds divine ; Such rich magnificence was never seen ; Superb the whole , a charming blessed demesne . The entrance ev ` ry way was open found ; But not a person could be viewed around , Except a negro , hideous to behold , Who much resembled AEsop , famed of old . OUR judge the negro for a porter took , Who was the house to clean and overlook ; And taking him for such , the black addressed , With full belief the title was the best , And that he greatly honored him , 'twas plain -LRB-B- Of ev ` ry color men are proud and vain : -RRB-B- Said he , my friend , what god this palace owns ? Too much it seems for those of earthly thrones ; No king , of consequence enough could be ; The palace , cried the black , belongs to me . THE judge was instantly upon his knees , The negro 's pardon asked , and sought to please ; I trust , said he , my lord , you 'll overlook The fault I made : my ignorance mistook . The universe has not so nice a spot ; The world so beautiful a palace got ! DOST wish me , said the black , the house to give , For thee and thine therein at ease to live ? On one condition thou shalt have the place For thee I seriously intend the grace , If thou ` lt on me a day or two attend , As page of honor : -- dost thou comprehend ? The custom know ` st thou -- better I 'll expound ; A cup-bearer with Jupiter is found , Thou ` st heard no doubt . Anselm What , Ganymede ? Negro The same ; And I 'm that Jupiter of mighty fame ; The chief supreme who rules above the skies ; Be thou the lad with fascinating eyes , Though not so handsome , nor in truth so young . Anselm You jest , my lord ; to youth I do n't belong ; ` Tis very clear ; -- my judge 's dress -- my age ! Negro I jest ? thou dream ` st. Anselm My lord ? Negro You wo n't engage ? Just as you will : -- ` tis all the same you 'll find . Anselm My lord ! ... The learned judge himself resigned , The black 's mysterious wishes to obey ; -- Alas ! curst presents , how they always weigh ! A PAGE the magistrate was quickly seen , In dress , in look , in age , in air , in mien ; His hat became a cap ; his beard alone Remained unchanged ; the rest had wholly flown . THUS metamorphosed to a pretty boy , The judge proceeded in the black 's employ . Within a corner hidden , Argia lay , And heard what Anselm had been led to say . The Moor howe'er was Manto , most renowned , Transformed , as oft the fairy we have found ; She built the charming palace by her art , -- Now youthful features would to age impart . AT length , as Anselm through a passage came , He suddenly beheld his beauteous dame . What ! learned Anselm do I see , said she , In this disguise ? -- It surely can not be ; My eyes deceive me : -- Anselm , grave and wise ; Give such a lesson ? I am all surprise . ` TIS doubtless he : oh , oh ! our bald-pate sire ; Ambassador and judge , we must admire , To see your honor thus in masquerade : -- At your age , truly , suffer to be made A -- modesty denies my tongue its powr 's What ! -- you condemn to death for freaks like ours ? You , whom I 've found \*\*\* you understand -- for shame Your crimes are such as all must blush to name . Though I may have a negro for gallant , And erred when Atis for me seemed to pant , His merit and the black 's superior rank , Must lessen , if not quite excuse my prank . Howe'er , old boy , you presently shall see , If any belle solicited should be , To grant indulgencies , with presents sweet , She will not straight capitulation beat ; At least , if they be such as I have viewed : -- Moor , change to dog ; immediately ensued The metamorphose that the fair required , The black ` moor was again a dog admired . Dance , fav ` rite ; instantly he skipped and played ; And to the judge his pretty paw conveyed . Spaniel , scatter gold ; presently there fell Large sums of money , as the sound could tell . Such strong temptation who can e ` er evade ? The dog a present to your wife was made . Then show me , if you can , upon the earth , A queen , a princess , of the highest birth , Who would not virtue presently concede , If such excuses for it she could plead ; Particularly if the giver proved A handsome lad that elegantly moved . I , TRULY , for the spaniel was exchanged ; What you 'd too much of , freely I arranged , To grant away , this jewel to obtain My value 's nothing great , you think , ` tis plain ; And , surely , you 'd have thought me very wrong , When such a prize I met , to haggle long . 'Twas he this palace raised ; but I have done ; Remember , since you 've yet a course to run , Take care again how you command my death ; In spite of your designs I draw my breath . Though none but Atis with me had success , I now desire , he may Lucretia bless , And wish her to surrender up her charms , -LRB-B- Just like myself -RRB-B- to his extended arms . If you approve , our peace at once is made : If not -- while I 've this dog I 'm not afraid , But you defy : I dread not swords nor bowl ; The little dog can warn me of the whole ; The jealous he confounds ; be that no more ; Such folly hence determine to give o ` er . If you , to put restraints on women choose , You 'll sooner far their fond affections lose . THE whole our judge conceded ; -- could he less ? The secret of his recent change of dress Was promised to be kept : and that unknown , E ` en cuckoldom again might there have flown . OUR couple mutual compensation made , Then bade adieu to hill , and dale , and glade . SOME critick asks the handsome palace ' fate ; I answer : -- that , my friend , I sha n't relate ; It disappeared , no matter how nor when . Why put such questions ? -- strict is not my pen . The little dog , pray what of that became ? To serve the lover was his constant aim . AND how was that ? -- You 're troublesome my friend : The dog perhaps would more assistance lend ; On new intrigues his master might be bent ; With single conquest who was e ` er content ? THE fav ` rite spaniel oft was missing found ; But when the little rogue had gone his round , He 'd then return , as if from work relieved , To her who first his services received . His fondness into fervent friendship grew ; As such gay Atis visited anew ; He often came , but Argia was sincere , And firmly to her vow would now adhere : Old Anselm too , had sworn , by heav ` n above ; No more to be suspicious of his love ; And , if he ever page became again , To suffer punishment 's severest pain .
