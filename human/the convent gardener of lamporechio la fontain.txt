THE CONVENT GARDENER OF LAMPORECHIO La Fontain WHEN Cupid with his dart , would hearts assail , The rampart most secure is not the VEIL ; A husband better will the FAIR protect , Than walls or lattices , I much suspect . Those parents , who in nunneries have got Their daughters -LRB-B- whether willingly or not -RRB-B- , Most clearly in a glaring error prove , To fancy God will round their actions move ; ` Tis an abuse of what we hold divine ; The Devil with them surely must combine . Besides , ` twere folly to suppose that vice Ne'er entered convent walls , and nuns were ice . A very diff ` rent sentiment I hold : Girls , who in publick move , however bold , Have greater terrors lest they get a stain ; For , honor lost , they never fame regain . Few enemies their modesty attack ; The others have but one their minds to rack . TEMPTATION , daughter of the drowsy dame , That hates to move , and IDLENESS we name , Is ever practising each wily art , To spread her snares around the throbbing heart ; And fond DESIRE , the child of lorn CONSTRAINT , Is anxious to the soul soft scenes to paint . If I 've a worthy daughter made a nun , Is that a reason she 's a saint ? -- Mere fun ! Avaunt such folly ! -- three in four you 'll find , Of those who wear the veil -- have changed their mind ; Their fingers bite , and often do much worse : Those convent vows , full soon , become a curse ; Such things at least have sometimes reached my ear -LRB-B- For doubtless I must speak from others here -RRB-B- ; Of his Boccace a merry tale has told , Which into rhyme I 've put , as you 'll behold . WITHIN a nunnery , in days of yore , A good old man supplied the garden-store ; The nuns , in general , were smart and gay , And kept their tongues in motion through the day . Religious duties they regarded less , Than for the palor \* to be nice in dress Arranging ev ` ry article to please , That each might captivate and charm at ease ; The changes constantly they rang around , And made the convent-walls with din resound . Eight sisters and an abbess held the place , And strange to say -- there DISCORD you might trace . All nine had youth , and many beauty too : Young friars round the place were oft in view , Who reckoned ev ` ry step they took so well , That always in the proper road they fell . Th ' aged gard ` ner , of whom ere now we spoke , Was oft bewildered , they would so provoke ; Capricious , whimsical , from day to day , Each would command and try to have her way ; And as they ne'er agreed among themselves , He suffered more than if with fifty elves ; When one was pleased , another soon complained : At length to quit the nuns he was constrained . He left them , poor and wretched as he came ; No cross , pile , money : -- e ` en his coat the same . A YOUTH of Lamporechio , gay and bold , One day this gard ` ner met as I am told ; And after conversation ` bout the place , Said , he should like nun 's service to embrace , And that he wished sincerely to be hired : He 'd gratis do whatever was required . 'Twas clear indeed his object was not pelf ; He thought however he might reward himself ; And as the sisters were not over wise , A nun he now and then might make his prize ; Proceed from one to more with like address , Till with the whole he 'd had complete success . Said Nuto -LRB-B- such we find the gard ` ner 's name -RRB-B- , Believe me , friend , you will be much to blame ; Some other service seek , I recommend ; These convent-dames will ne'er their whimseys end . I 'd rather live without or soup or bread , Than work for them , however nicely fed . STRANGE creatures are these nuns , upon my word ; Their ways ridiculous and e ` en absurd ; Who , with the sisterhood , has never been , Has clearly yet , not perfect torment seen , Such service , prithee , never try to gain ; To do what they require I know is vain ; One will have soft , and t ` other asks for hard : Thou ` lt be a fool such ninnies to regard ; No work thou ` lt do , whatever be the want : THIS cabbages , -- THAT carrots tells thee plant : Said t ` other , fain I 'd bring it to the test ; I 'm but a simpleton , it is confessed ; Yet still a month in place , and thou wilt see ; How well I with the convent-dames agree . The reason is , my life is in its prime , While thou art sunk in years and worn by time , I 'm proper for their work , and only ask , To be admitted to the drudging task . Well , said the former , if resolved to try , To their factotum instantly apply ; Come ; let 's away . Lead on , the other cried ; I 've got a thought , which I 'll to you confide : -- I 'll seem an idiot , and quite dumb appear . -- In that , said Nuto , only persevere , And then perhaps the confessor thou ` lt find , With their factotum carelessly inclined ; No fears nor dark suspicions of a mute : Thou ` lt ev ` ry way , my friend , their wishes suit . THE place , as was expected , soon he got ; And half the grounds to trench , at once his lot : He acted well the nincompoop and fool , Yet still was steady to the garden tool ; The nuns continually would flock around , And much amusement in his anticks found . ONE day , as sleeping lay our sprightly wight , Or feigning sleep , no matter which is right , -LRB-B- Boccace pretends the latter was the fact -RRB-B- Two nuns -LRB-B- perhaps not two the most exact , -RRB-B- Observing him extended on the sward , While summer 's heat from air so much debarred ; That few would venture from the convent-roof , Lest , ` gainst the sun , their cheeks should not be proof : Said one , approaching him , let 's take this fool , And place him in the garden-house to cool . The lad was handsome , with engaging mien : The nun admired the features she had seen , And Cupid raised a wish to be at ease , Where she , without restraint , herself might please . What would you , cried the other , with him do ? You 'll see , rejoined the first , if we pursue ; Just what might be expected from the place ; Christ ! said the second -LRB-B- with a cross of grace -RRB-B- , You would not surely do what is forbid ? Suppose increase ? it never could be hid ; Besides , should we be seen , ` twill be the cause , Of dire disgrace to break such sacred laws . WE shall not be observed , the first replied ; These ills thy fancy forms : haste , let 's decide , And seize the moment while ` tis in our reach , Without regard to what old dotards teach , Or what may happen at a future hour ; Here 's no one near : ` tis fully in our pow ` r ; The time and place so thoroughly agree , ` Twill be impossible our freaks to see ; But ` twill be right that one should watch with care ; While t ` other with the lad seeks joys to share , And irksome gloom endeavors to dispel : He 's dumb , you know , and tales can never tell . The other answered , since ` tis your desire , I 'll acquiesce and do what you require ; You 'll take him first : I see it is your aim ; And since it will oblige , I 'll wave my claim ; Go , pleasure seek , and satisfy each wish : You 're always anxious for a fav ` rite dish ; ` Tis only to oblige that I comply . That , said the other , clearly I descry ; I 'm well persuaded , thou art always kind ; But still I think thou would ` st not be inclined ; In such a scene to take the leading part , Thy bashfulness would counteract thy heart . Some time the squeamish sister watched the spot ; At length the other , who 'd her wishes got , The station took ; the lab ` rer tried to please The second as the first , but less at ease ; So many favors fell not to her share , And only treble comfort proved her fare . THE garden-path , and summer-house as well , Were well remembered by each wanton belle ; No need of guides ; and soon our spark contrived ; With sister Agnes also to be hived A press-house at the convent end he chose , in which he showed her how soft pleasure flows ; Nor Claudia nor Angelica would miss The dormitory that , and cellar this ; In short the garret and the vaulted cave Knew fully how the sisters could behave ; Not one but what he first or last regaled E ` en with the rigid abbess he prevailed , To take a dance , and as the dame required Her treble share of what was most admired , The other nuns were oft obliged to fast , While with the convent-head his time was passed . To no restoratives our Wight would run ; Though these do little , where much work is done : So oft the lad was pressed for cheering play , That with the abbess , when engaged one day , He said , where'er I go , ` tis common talk , With only sev ` n an able bird should walk , Yet constantly I 've got no less than nine : -- The abbess cried , -- A miracle divine ! Here nuns , pray haste , and quickly come around ; We 've fasted with success : -- his tongue is found . The eight encircled him with great surprise ; No longer dumb . -- they viewed with eager eyes : A consultation instantly was had , When 'twas agreed to honor well the lad , And try to make him secrecy observe ; But if dismissed , from silence he might swerve . The active youth , well fed , well paid , thus blessed , Did all he could , -- and others did the rest . He for the nuns procured a little lot , That afterward two little friars got , And in the sequel fathers soon became ; The sisters mothers too , in spite of shame ; But never name more justly was applied : In vain their mysteries they strove to hide . \* The parlor in a convent is the room where the nuns are permitted to speak to their friends through a lattice .
