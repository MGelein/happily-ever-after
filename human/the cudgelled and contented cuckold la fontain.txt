THE CUDGELLED AND CONTENTED CUCKOLD La Fontain SOME time ago from Rome , in smart array , A younger brother homeward bent his way , Not much improved , as frequently the case With those who travel to that famous place . Upon the road oft finding , where he stayed , Delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid , With careless ease he loitered up and down . -- One day there passed him in a country town , Attended by a page , a lady fair , Whose charming form and all-engaging air , At once his bosom fired with fond desire ; And nearer still , her beauties to admire . He most gallantly saw her safely home ; Attentions charm the sex where'er we roam . OUR thoughtless rambler pleasures always sought : From Rome this spark had num ` rous pardons brought ; But , -- as to virtues -LRB-B- this too oft we find -RRB-B- , He 'd left them , -- with his HOLINESS behind ! THE lady was , by ev ` ry one , confessed , Of beauty , youth , and elegance possessed ; She wanted naught to form her bliss below , But one whose love would ever fondly flow . INDEED so fickle proved this giddy youth , That nothing long would please his heart or tooth ; Howe'er he earnestly inquired her name , And ev ` ry other circumstance the same . She 's lady , they replied , to great ` squire Good , Who 's almost bald from age ` tis understood ; But as he 's rich , and high in rank appears , Why that 's a recompense you know for years . THESE facts our young gallant no sooner gained , But ardent hopes at once he entertained ; To wily plots his mind he quickly bent , And to a neighb ` ring town his servants sent ; Then , at the house where dwelled our noble ` squire , His humble services proposed for hire . PRETENDING ev ` ry sort of work he knew , He soon a fav ` rite with old Square-toes grew , Who -LRB-B- first advising with his charming mate -RRB-B- , Chief falc ` ner made him o ` er his fine estate . THE new domestick much the lady pleased ; He watched and eagerly the moment seized , His ardent passion boldly to declare , In which he showed a novice had no share . 'TWAS managed well , for nothing but the chase , Could Square-toes tempt to quit her fond embrace , And then our falc ` ner must his steps attend : -- The very time he wished at home to spend . The lady similar emotions showed ; For opportunity their bosoms glowed ; And who will feel in argument so bold , When this I say , the contrary to hold ? At length with pity Cupid saw the case , And kindly lent his aid to their embrace . ONE night the lady said , with eager eyes , My dear , among our servants , which d'ye prize , For moral conduct most and upright heart ? To this her spouse replied , the faithful part Is with the falc ` ner found , I must decide : To him my life I 'd readily confide . THEN you are wrong , said she , -- most truly so , For he 's a good-for-nothing wretch I know ; You 'll scarcely credit it , but t ` other day , He had the barefaced impudence to say , He loved me much , and then his passion pressed : I 'd nearly fallen , I was so distressed . To tear his eyes out , I designed at first , And e ` en to choke this wretch , of knaves the worst ; By prudence solely was I then restrained , For fear the world should think his point was gained . THE better then to prove his dark intent , I feigned an inclination to consent , And in the garden , promised as to-night , I 'd near the pear-tree meet this roguish wight . Said I , my husband never moves from hence ; No jealous fancy , but to show the sense He entertains of my pure , virtuous life , And fond affection for a loving wife . Thus circumstanced , your wishes see are vain , Unless when he 's asleep a march I gain , And softly stealing from his torpid side , With trembling steps I , to my lover , glide . So things remain , my dear ; an odd affair : -- On this Square-toes ` gan to curse and swear ; But his fond rib most earnestly besought , His rage to stifle , as she clearly thought , He might in person , if he 'd take the pain , Secure the rascal and redress obtain You know , said she , the tree is near the door , Upon the left and bears of fruit great store ; But if I may my sentiments express , In cap and petticoats you 'd best to dress ; His insolence is great , and you 'll be right , To give your strokes with double force to night ; Well work his back ; flat lay him on the ground : -- A rascal ! honorable ladies round , No doubt he many times has served the same ; ` Tis such impostors characters defame . To rouse his wrath the story quite sufficed ; The spouse resolved to do as she advised . Howe'er to dupe him was an easy lot ; The hour arrived , his dress he soon had got , Away he ran with anxious fond delight . In hopes the wily spark to trap that night . But no one there our easy fool could see , And while he waited near the fav ` rite tree , Half dead with cold , the falc ` ner slyly stole , To her who had so well contrived the whole ; Time , place , and disposition , all combined The loving pair to mutual joys resigned . When our expert gallant had with the dame , An hour or more indulged his ardent flame , Though forced at length to quit the loving lass , 'Twas not without the favorite parting glass ; He then the garden sought , where long the ` squire , Upon the knave had wished to vent his ire . NO sooner he the silly husband spied , But feigning 'twas the wily wife he eyed , At once he cried , -- ah , vilest of the sex ! Are these thy tricks , so good a man to vex ? Oh shame upon thee ! thus to treat his love , As pure as snow , descending from above . I could not think thou hadst so base a heart , But clear it is , thou need ` st a friendly part , And that I 'll act : I asked this rendezvous With full intent to see if thou wert true ; And , God be praised , without a loose design , To plunge in luxuries pronounced divine . Protect me Heav ` n ! poor sinner that I 'm here ! To guard thy honor I will persevere . My worthy master could I thus disgrace ? Thou wanton baggage with unblushing face , Thee on the spot I 'll instantly chastise , And then thy husband of the fact advise . THE fierce harangue o ` er Square-toes pleasure spread , Who , mutt ` ring ` tween his teeth , with fervor said : O gracious Lord ! to thee my thanks are due -- To have a wife so chaste -- a man so true ! But presently he felt upon his back The falc ` ner 's cudgel vigorously thwack , Who soundly basted him as on he ran , To gain the house , with terror , pale and wan . THE squire had wished his trusty man , no doubt , Had not , at cudgelling , been quite so stout ; But since he showed himself so true a friend , And with his actions could such prudence blend , The master fully pardoned what he knew , And quickly to his wife in bed he flew , When he related every thing that passed Were we , cried he , a hundred years to last , My lovely dear , we ne'er on earth could find A man so faithful , and so well inclined . I 'd have him take within our town a wife , And you and I 'll regard him during life . In that , replied the lady , we agree , And heartily thereto I pledged will be .
