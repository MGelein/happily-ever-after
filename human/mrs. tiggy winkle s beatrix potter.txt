MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE 'S Beatrix Potter nose went sniffle , sniffle , snuffle , and her eyes went twinkle , twinkle ; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire . `` THERE 'S one of my pocket-handkins ! '' cried Lucie -- `` and there 's my pinny ! '' Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it , and goffered it , and shook out the frills . `` Oh that IS lovely ! '' said Lucie . `` AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves ? '' `` Oh , that 's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny - penny -- look how she 's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard ! She 'll very soon go barefoot ! '' said Mrs. Tiggy - winkle . `` WHY , there 's another handkersniff -- but it is n't mine ; it 's red ? '' `` Oh no , if you please 'm ; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit ; and it DID so smell of onions ! I 've had to wash it separately , I ca n't get out the smell . '' `` There 's another one of mine , '' said Lucie . `` WHAT are those funny little white things ? '' `` That 's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten ; I only have to iron them ; she washes them herself . '' `` There 's my last pocket - handkin ! '' said Lucie . `` AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch ? '' `` They 're little dicky shirt - fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse -- most terrible particular ! '' said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle . `` Now I 've finished my ironing ; I 'm going to air some clothes . '' `` WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things ? '' said Lucie . `` Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl . '' `` Will their jackets take off ? '' asked Lucy . `` Oh yes , if you please 'm ; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder . And here 's one marked for Gatesgarth , and three that come from Little-town . They 're ALWAYS marked at washing ! '' said Mrs. Tiggy - winkle . AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes -- small brown coats of mice ; and one velvety black mole - skin waist-coat ; and a red tail - coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin ; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit ; and a petticoat , not marked , that had gone lost in the washing -- and at last the basket was empty ! THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea -- a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie . They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another . Mrs. Tiggy-winkle 's hand , holding the tea-cup , was very very brown , and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds ; and all through her gown and her cap , there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out ; so that Lucie did n't like to sit too near her . WHEN they had finished tea , they tied up the clothes in bundles ; and Lucie 's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny , and fastened with a silver safety-pin . And then they made up the fire with turf , and came out and locked the door , and hid the key under the door-sill . THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes ! All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them ; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny ! AND she gave them their nice clean clothes ; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle . SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile , there was nothing left to carry except Lucie 's one little bundle . LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand ; and then she turned to say `` Good-night , '' and to thank the washer-woman -- But what a VERY odd thing ! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill ! She was running running running up the hill -- and where was her white frilled cap ? and her shawl ? and her gown -- and her petticoat ? AND how small she had grown -- and how brown -- and covered with PRICKLES ! Why ! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG . -LRB-B- Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile -- but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny , pinned with a silver safety-pin ? And besides -- _ I _ have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat BellsS -- and besides _ I _ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ! -RRB-B-
