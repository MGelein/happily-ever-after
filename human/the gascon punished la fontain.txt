THE GASCON PUNISHED La Fontain A GASCON -LRB-B- being heard one day to swear , That he 'd possess 'd a certain lovely fair , -RRB-B- Was played a wily trick , and nicely served ; 'Twas clear , from truth he shamefully had swerved : But those who scandal propagate below , Are prophets thought , and ev ` ry action know ; While good , if spoken , scarcely is believed , And must be viewed , or not for truth received . THE dame , indeed , the Gascon only jeered , And e ` er denied herself when he appeared ; But when she met the wight , who sought to shine ; And called her angel , beauteous and divine , She fled and hastened to a female friend , Where she could laugh , and at her ease unbend . NEAR Phillis , -LRB-B- our fair fugitive -RRB-B- there dwelled One Eurilas , his nearest neighbor held ; His wife was Cloris ; 'twas with her our dove Took shelter from the Gascon 's forward love , Whose name was Dorilas ; and Damon young , -LRB-B- The Gascon 's friend -RRB-B- on whom gay Cloris hung . SWEET Phillis , by her manner , you might see , From sly amours and dark intrigues was free ; The value to possess her no one knew , Though all admired the lovely belle at view . Just twenty years she counted at the time , And now a widow was , though in her prime , -LRB-B- Her spouse , an aged dotard , worth a plum : -- Of those whose loss to mourn no tears e ` er come . -RRB-B- OUR seraph fair , such loveliness possessed , In num ` rous ways a Gascon could have blessed ; Above , below , appeared angelic charms ; 'Twas Paradise , 'twas Heav ` n , within her arms ! THE Gascon was -- a Gascon ; -- would you more ? Who knows a Gascon knows at least a score . I need not say what solemn vows he made ; Alike with NormansS GasconsS are portrayed ; Their oaths , indeed , wo n't pass for Gospel truth ; But we believe that Dorilas -LRB-B- the youth -RRB-B- Loved Phillis to his soul , our lady fair , Yet he would fain be thought successful there . ONE day , said Phillis , with unusual glee , Pretending with the Gascon to be free : -- A favor do me : -- nothing very great ; Assist to dupe one jealous of his mate ; You 'll find it very easy to be done , And doubtless ` twill produce a deal of fun . ` Tis our request -LRB-B- the plot you 'll say is deep , -RRB-B- That you this night with Cloris 's husband sleep Some disagreement with her gay gallant Requires , that she a night at least should grant , To settle diff ` rences ; now we desire , That you 'll to bed with EurilasS retire , There 's not a doubt he 'll think his Cloris near ; He never touches her : -- so nothing fear ; For whether jealousy , or other pains , He constantly from intercourse abstains , Snores through the night , and , if a cap he sees , Believes his wife in bed , and feels at ease . We 'll properly equip you as a belle , And I will certainly reward you well . TO gain but Phillis 's smiles , the Gascon said , He 'd with the very devil go to bed . THE night arrived , our wight the chamber traced ; The lights extinguished ; Eurilas , too , placed ; The Gascon ` gan to tremble in a trice , And soon with terror grew as cold as ice ; Durst neither spit nor cough ; still less encroach ; And seemed to shrink , least t ` other should approach ; Crept near the edge ; would scarcely room afford , And could have passed the scabbard of a sword . OFT in the night his bed-fellow turned round ; At length a finger on his nose he found , Which Dorilas exceedingly distressed ; But more inquietude was in his breast , For fear the husband amorous should grow , From which incalculable ills might flow . OUR Gascon ev ` ry minute knew alarm ; 'Twas now a leg stretched out , and then an arm ; He even thought he felt the husband 's beard ; But presently arrived what more he feared . A BELL , conveniently , was near the bed , Which Eurilas to ring was often led ; At this the Gascon swooned , so great his fear , And swore , for ever he 'd renounce his dear . But no one coming , Eurilas , once more , Resumed his place , and ` gan again to snore . AT length , before the sun his head had reared ; The door was opened , and a torch appeared . Misfortune then he fancied full in sight ; More pleased he 'd been to rise without a light , And clearly thought 'twas over with him now ; The flame approached ; -- the drops ran o ` er his brow ; With terror he for pardon humbly prayed : -- You have it , cried a fair : be not dismayed ; 'Twas Phillis spoke , who EurilasS 's place Had filled , throughout the night , with wily grace , And now to Damon and his Cloris flew , With ridicule the Gascon to pursue ; Recounted all the terrors and affright , Which Dorilas had felt throughout the night . To mortify still more the silly swain , And fill his soul with ev ` ry poignant pain , She gave a glimpse of beauties to his view , And from his presence instantly withdrew .
