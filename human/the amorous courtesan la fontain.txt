THE AMOROUS COURTESAN La Fontain DAN CUPID , though the god of soft amour , In ev ` ry age works miracles a store ; Can Catos change to male coquets at ease ; And fools make oracles whene'er he please ; Turn wolves to sheep , and ev ` ry thing so well , That naught remains the former shape to tell : Remember , Hercules , with wond ` rous pow ` r , And Polyphemus , who would men devour : The one upon a rock himself would fling , And to the winds his am ` rous ditties sing ; To cut his beard a nymph could him inspire ; And , in the water , he 'd his face admire . His club the other to a spindle changed , To please the belle with whom he often ranged . A hundred instances the fact attest , But sage Boccace has one , it is confessed , Which seems to me , howe'er we search around , To be a sample , rarely to be found . ` Tis Chimon that I mean , a savage youth , Well formed in person , but the rest uncouth , A-bear in mind , but Cupid much can do , LOVE licked the cub , and decent soon he grew . A fine gallant at length the lad appeared ; From whence the change ? -- Fine eyes his bosom cheered The piercing rays no sooner reached his sight , But all the savage took at once to flight ; He felt the tender flame ; polite became ; You 'll find howe'er , our tale is not the same . I MEAN to state how once an easy fair , Who oft amused the youth devoid of care , A tender flame within her heart retained , Though haughty , singular , and unrestrained . Not easy 'twas her favors to procure ; Rome was the place where dwelled this belle impure ; The mitre and the cross with her were naught ; Though at her feet , she 'd give them not a thought ; And those who were not of the highest class , No moments were allowed with her to pass . A member of the conclave , first in rank , To be her slave , she 'd scarcely deign to thank ; Unless a cardinal 's gay nephew came , And then , perhaps , she 'd listen to his flame ; The pope himself , had he perceived her charms , Would not have been too good to grace her arms . Her pride appeared in clothes as well as air , And on her sparkled gold and jewels rare ; In all the elegance of dress arrayed , Embroidery and lace , her taste displayed . THE god of soft amour beheld her aim ; And sought at once her haughty soul to tame ; A Roman gentleman , of finest form , Soon in her bosom raised a furious storm ; Camillus was the name this youth had got ; The nymph 's was Constance , that LOVE 'S arrow shot : Though he was mild , good humored , and serene , No sooner Constance had his person seen , And in her breast received the urchin 's dart , Than throbs , and trembling fears o ` erwhelmed her heart . The flame she durst declare no other way , Than by those sighs , which feelings oft betray . Till then , nor shame nor aught could her retain ; Now all was changed : -- her bashfulness was plain . As none , howe'er , could think the subtle flame Would lie concealed with such a haughty dame , Camillus nothing of the kind supposed . Though she incessantly by looks disclosed , That something unrevealed disturbed the soul , And o ` er her mind had absolute control . Whatever presents Constance might receive , Still pensive sighs her breast appeared to heave : Her tints of beauty too , began to fail , And o ` er the rose , the lily to prevail . ONE night Camillus had a party met , Of youthful beaux and belles , a charming set , And , ` mong the rest , fair Constance was a guest ; The evening passed in jollity and jest ; For few to holy converse seemed inclined , And none for MethodistsS appeared designed : Not one , but Constance , deaf to wit was found , And , on her , raillery went briskly round . THE supper o ` er the company withdrew , But Constance suddenly was lost to view ; Beside a certain bed she took her seat , Where no one ever dreamed she would retreat , And all supposed , that ill , or spirits weak , She home had run , or something wished to seek . THE company retired , Camillus said , He meant to write before he went to bed , And told his valet he might go to rest A lucky circumstance , it is confessed . Thus left alone , and as the belle desired ; Who , from her soul , the spark so much admired ; Yet knew not how the subject to disclose , Or , in what way her wishes to propose ; At length , with trembling accents , she revealed ; The flame she longer could not keep concealed . EXCEEDINGLY surprised Camillus seemed , And scarcely could believe but what he dreamed ; Why , hey ! said he , good lady , is it thus , With favored friends , you doubtful points discuss ? He made her sit , and then his seat regained Who would have thought , cried he , you here remained ; Now who this hiding place to you could tell ? 'Twas LOVE , fond LOVE ! replied the beauteous belle ; And straight a blush her lovely cheek suffused , So rare with those to Cyprian revels used ; For Venus 's vot ` ries , to pranks resigned , Another way , to get a color , find . CAMILLUS , truly , some suspicions had , That he was loved , though neither fool nor mad ; Nor such a novice in the Paphian scene , But what he could at once some notions glean : More certain tokens , howsoe'er , to get , And set the lady 's feelings on the fret , By trying if the gloom that o ` er her reigned Was only sly pretence , he coldness feigned . SHE often sighed as if her heart would break ; At length love 's piercing anguish made her speak : What you will say , cried she , I can not guess , To see me thus a fervent flame confess . The very thought my face with crimson dyes ; My way of life no shield for this supplies ; The moment pure affection 's in the soul , No longer wanton freaks the mind control . MY conduct to excuse , what can I say ? O could my former life be done away , And in your recollection naught remain , But what might virtuous constancy maintain At all event , my frankness overlook , Too well I see , the fatal path I took Has such displeasure to your breast conveyed , My zeal will rather hurt than give me aid ; But hurt or not , I 'll idolize you still : Beat , drive away , contemn me as you will ; Or worse , if you the torment can contrive I 'm your 's alone , Camillus , while alive . TO this harangue the wary youth replied In truth , fair lady , I could ne'er decide , To criticise what others round may do . -- ` Tis not the line I 'd willingly pursue ; And I will freely say , that your discourse Has much surprised me , though ` tis void of force . To you it surely never can belong , To say variety in love is wrong ; Besides , your sex , and decency , ` tis clear , To ev ` ry disadvantage you appear . What use this eloquence , and what your aim ? Such charms alone as your 's could me inflame ; Their pow ` r is great , but fully I declare , I do not like advances from the FAIR . To Constance this a thunder-clap appeared ; Howe'er , she in her purpose persevered . Said she , this treatment doubtless I deserve ; But still , from truth my tongue can never swerve , And if I may presume my thoughts to speak , The plan which I 've pursued your love to seek , Had never proved injurious to my cause , If still my beauty merited applause . From what you 've said , and what your looks express To please your sight , no charms I now possess . Whence comes this change ? -- to you I will refer ; Till now I was admired , you must aver ; And ev ` ry one my person highly praised ; These precious gifts , that admiration raised , Alas ! are fled , and since I felt LOVE 'S flame , Experience whispers , I 'm no more the same ; No longer have charms that please your eyes : How happy I should feel if they 'd suffice ! THE suppliant belle now hoped to be allowed One half his bed to whom her sighs were vowed ; But terror closed her lips ; she nothing said , Though oft her eyes were to his pillow led . To be confused the wily stripling feigned , And like a statue for a time remained . AT length he said : -- I know not what to do ; Undressing , by myself , I ca n't pursue . Shall I your valet call ? rejoined the fair ; On no account , said he , with looks of care ; I would not have you in my chamber seen , Nor thought that here , by night , a girl had been , Your caution is enough , the belle replied : Myself between the wall and bed I 'll hide , ` Twill what you fear prevent , and ills avoid ; But bolt the door : you 'll then be not annoyed ; Let no one come ; for once I 'll do my best , And as your valet act till you 're undressed ; To am ` rous Constance this permission grant The honor would her throbbing breast enchant . THE youth to her proposal gave consent , And Constance instantly to business went ; The means she used to take his clothes were such , That scarcely once his person felt her touch ; She stopt not there , but even freely chose To take from off his feet , both shoes and hose What , say you : -- With her hands did Constance this ? Pray tell me what you see therein amiss ? I wish sincerely I could do the same , With one for whom I feel a tender flame . BETWEEN the clothes in haste Camillus flew , Without inviting Constance to pursue . She thought at first he meant to try her love ; But raillery , this conduct was above . His aim , howe'er more fully to unfold , She presently observed : -- ` Tis very cold ; Where shall I sleep ? said she : Camillus Just where you please ; Constance What , on this chair ? Camillus No , no , be more at ease ; Come into bed . Constance Unlace me then , I pray . Camillus I can not : I 'm undressed , and cold as clay : Unlace yourself . -- Just then the belle perceived A poinard , which anxiety relieved ; She drew it from the scabbard , cut her lace , And many parts of dress designed for grace , The works of months , embroidery and flow ' r Now perished in the sixtieth of an hour , Without regret , or seeming to lament , What more than life will of the sex content . YE dames of Britain , Germany , or France , Would you have done as much , through complaisance ? You would not , I 'm convinced : the thing is clear ; But doubtless this , at Rome , must fine appear . POOR Constance softly to the bed approached , No longer now supposing she encroached , And trusting that , no stratagem again Would be contrived to give her bosom pain . Camillus said : my sentiments I 'll speak ; Dissimulation I will never seek ; She who can proffer what should be denied , Shall never be admitted by my side ; But if the place your approbation meet , I wo n't refuse your lying at my feet . FAIR Constance such reproof could not withstand , 'Twas well the poinard was not in her hand ; Her bosom so severely felt the smart , She would have plunged the dagger through her heart : But Hope , sweet Hope ! still fluttered to her view ; And young Camillus pretty well she knew ; Howe'er with such severity he spoke , That e ` en the mildest saint it would provoke ; Yet , in a swain so easy , gentle , kind , 'Twas strange so little lenity to find . SHE placed herself , as order 'd , cross the bed , And at his feet at length reclined her head ; A kiss on them she ventured to impress , But not too roughly , lest she should transgress : We may conjecture if he were at ease ; What victory ! to see her stoop to please ; A beauty so renowned for charms and pride , ` Twould take a week , to note each trait described ; No other fault than paleness he could trace , Which gave her -LRB-B- causes known -RRB-B- still higher grace . CAMILLUS stretched his legs , and on her breast Familiarly allowed his feet to rest ; A cushion made of what so fair appeared , That envy might from ivory be feared ; Then seemed as if to Morpheus he inclined , And on the pillow sullenly resigned . At last the sighs with which her bosom heaved , Gave vent to floods of tears that much relieved ; This was the end : -- Camillus silence broke , And to tell the belle with pleasing accents spoke I 'm satisfied , said he , your love is pure ; Come hither charming girl and be secure . She t ` wards him moved ; Camillus near her slid ; Could you , cried he , believe that what I did , Was seriously the dictates of my soul , To act the brute and ev ` ry way control ? No , no , sweet fair , you know me not ` tis plain : I truly wish your fondest love to gain ; Your heart I 've probed , ` tis all that I desire ; Mid joys I swim ; my bosom feels the fire . Your rigor now in turn you may display ; It is but fair : be bountiful I pray ; Myself from hence your lover I declare ; No woman merits more my bed to share , Whatever rank , or beauty , sense or life , You equally deserve to be my wife ; Your husband I 'll become ; forget the past ; Unpleasant recollections should not last . Yet there 's one thing which much I wish to speak The marriage must be secret that we seek ; There 's no occasion reasons to disclose ; What I have said I trust will you dispose , To act as I desire : you 'll find it best : -- A wedding 's like amours while unconfessed ; One THEN both husband and gallant appears , And ev ` ry wily act the bosom cheers . Till we , continued he , a priest can find , Are you , to trust my promises inclined ? You safely may ; he 'll to his word adhere : His heart is honest , and his tongue sincere . TO this fair Constance answered not a word , Which showed , with him , her sentiments concurred . The spark , no novice in the dumb assent , Received her silence fully as 'twas meant ; The rest involved in myst ` ry deep remains ; Thus Constance was requitted for her pains . YE Cyprian nymphs to profit turn my tale ; The god of LOVE , within his vot ` ries pale , Has many , if their sentiments were known , That I 'd prefer for Hymen 's joys alone . My wife , not always to the spindle true , Will many things in life , not seem to view ; By Constance and her conduct you may see How , with this theory , her acts agree ; She proved the truth of what I here advance , And reaped the fruits produced by complaisance , A horde of nuns I know who , ev ` ry night , Would such adventures wage with fond delight . PERHAPS it will not be with ease believed , That Constance from Camillus now received , A proof of LOVE 'S enchanting balmy sweet , A proof perhaps you 'll think her used to meet ; But ne'er till then she tasted pleasures pure ; Her former life no blisses could secure . You ask the cause , and signs of doubt betray : Who TRULY loves , the same will ever say .
