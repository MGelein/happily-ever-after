THE TRUCKERS La Fontain THE change of food enjoyment is to man ; In this , t ` include the woman is my plan . I can not guess why Rome will not allow Exchange in wedlock , and its leave avow ; Not ev ` ry time such wishes might arise , But , once in life at least , ` twere not unwise ; Perhaps one day we may the boon obtain ; Amen , I say : my sentiments are plain ; The privilege in France may yet arrive There trucking pleases , and exchanges thrive ; The people love variety , we find ; And such by heav ` n was ere for them designed . ONCE there dwelled , near Rouen , -LRB-B- sapient clime -RRB-B- Two villagers , whose wives were in their prime , And rather pleasing in their shape and mien , For those in whom refinement 's scarcely seen . Each looker-on conceives , LOVE needs not greet Such humble wights , as he would prelates treat . IT happened , howsoe'er , both weary grown , Of halves that they so long had called their own ; One holyday , with them there chanced to drink The village lawyer -LRB-B- bred in Satan 's sink -RRB-B- ; To him , said one of these , with jeering air , Good mister Oudinet , a strange affair Is in my head : you 've doubtless often made Variety of contracts ; ` tis your trade : Now , can not you contrive , by one of these , That men should barter wives , like goods , at ease ? Our pastor oft his benefice has changed ; Is trucking wives less easily arranged ? It can not be , for well I recollect , That Parson Gregory -LRB-B- whom none suspect -RRB-B- Would always say , or much my mem ` ry fails , My flock 's my wife : love equally prevails ; He changed ; let us , good neighbor do the same ; With all my heart , said t ` other , that 's my aim ; But well thou know ` st that mine 's the fairest face , And , Mister Oudinet , since that 's the case , Should he not add , at least , his mule to boot ? My mule ? rejoined the first , that will not suit ; In this world ev ` ry thing has got its price : Mine I will change for thine and that 's concise . Wives are not viewed so near ; naught will I add ; Why , neighbor Stephen , dost thou think me mad , To give my mule to boot ? -- of mules the king ; Not e ` en an ass I 'd to the bargain bring ; Change wife for wife , the barter will be fair ; Then each will act with t ` other on the square . THE village lawyer now the friends addressed : Said he , Antoinetta is confessed To have superior charms to those of Jane ; But still , if I may venture to be plain , Not always is the best what meets the eye , For many beauties in concealment lie , Which I prefer ; and these are hid with care ; Deceptions , too , are practiced by the FAIR ; Howe'er , we wish the whole to be disclosed , Too much , ` tis said , they must not be exposed . NOW , neighbors , let us fair arrangement make : A pig in poke you 'd neither give nor take ; Confront these halves in nature 's birth-day suit ; To neither , then , will you deceit impute . The project was most thoroughly approved ; Like inclination both the husbands moved . ANTOINETTA , said the second spouse , Has neither ill nor scratch her fears to rouse . Jane , cried the first , is ev ` ry way complete ; No freckles on the skin : as balm she 's sweet : Antoinetta is , her spouse replied , Ambrosia ev ` ry way : no fault to hide . SAID t ` other : -- Do n't so confident appear ; Thou know ` st not Jane : her ways would marble cheer ; And there 's a play : -- thou understand ` st no doubt ? To this rejoined the second village lout , One diff ` rence only have my wife and I : Which plays the prettiest wiles is what we try ; Thou ` lt very soon of these know how to think ; Here 's to thee , neighbor ; Mister Oud ` net , drink ; Come , toast Antoinetta ; likewise Jane ; The mule was granted , and the bargain plain : Our village lawyer promised to prepare , At once , the writings , which would all declare . This Oudinet a good apostle proved Well paid for parchment , or he never moved : By whom was payment made ? -- by both the dames ; On neither husband showed he any claims . THE village clowns some little time supposed That all was secret : not a hint disclosed ; The parson of it , howsoe'er , obtained Some intimation , and his off ` rings gained . I was not present , fully I admit ; But rarely clergymen their dues will quit . The very clerk would not remit his fee : -- All those who serve the church in this agree . THE permutation could not well be made , But scandal would such practices upbraid ; In country villages each step is seen ; Thus , round the whisper went of what had been , And placed at length the thorn where all was ease ; The pow ` rs divine alone it could displease . 'Twas pleasant them together to behold ; The wives , in emulation , were not cold ; In easy talk they 'd to each other say : How pleasing to exchange from day to day ! What think you , neighbor , if , to try our luck , For once we 've something new , and valets truck ? This last , if made , the secret had respect ; The other had at first a good effect . FOR one good month the whole proceeded well ; But , at the end , disgust dispersed the spell ; And neighbor Stephen , as we might suppose , Began dissatisfaction to disclose ; Lamented much Antoinetta 's stop ; No doubt he was a loser by the swop ; Yet neighbor Giles expressed extreme regret , That t ` other from him ought to boot should get : Howe'er , he would retrucking not consent , So much he otherwise appeared content . IT happened on a day , as Stephen strayed Within a wood , he saw , beneath a shade , And near the stream , asleep , and quite alone , Antoinetta , whom he wished his own . He near her drew , and waked her with surprise ; The change ne'er struck her when she ope 'd her eyes ; The gay gallant advantage quickly took , And , what he wished , soon placed within his hook . ` Tis said , he found her better than at first ; Why so ? you ask : was she then at the worst ? A curious question , truly , you 've designed ; In Cupid 's am ` rous code of laws you 'll find -- Bread got by stealth , and eat where none can spy , Is better far than what you bake or buy ; For proof of this , ask those most learn 'd in love Truth we prefer , all other things above ; Yet Hymen , and the god of soft desire , How much soe'er their union we admire , Are not designed together bread to bake ; In proof , the sleeping scene for instance take . Good cheer was there : each dish was served with taste ; The god of love , who often cooks in haste , Most nicely seasoned things to relish well ; In this he 's thought old Hymen to excel . ANTOINETTA , to his clasp restored , Our neighbor Stephen , who his wife adored , Quite raw , howe'er , in this , exclaimed apart Friend Giles has surely got some secret art , For now my rib displays superior charms , To what she had , before she left my arms . Let 's take her back , and play the Norman trick Deny the whole , and by our priv ` lege stick . IMMEDIATELY he ev ` ry effort tried , To get the bargain fully set aside . Giles , much distressed , exerted all his might , To keep his prize , and prove his conduct right . The cause was carried to the bishop 's court ; Much noise it made , according to report . At length the parliament would hear the claim , And judge a case of such peculiar fame . THE village lawyer , Oudinet , was brought ; From him , who drew the contract , truth was sought ; There rests the cause , for ` tis of recent date ; While undecided , more we can not state . HOW silly neighbor Stephen must appear ! He went against his int ` rest now ` tis clear ; For , when superior pleasure he was shown , The fascinating fair was not his own . Good sense would whisper then , ` twere full as well , To let remain with Giles the beauteous belle ; Save now and then , within the leafy shade , Where oft Antoinetta visits made , And warbled to the shrubs and trees around ; There he might easily the nymph have found , But , if with ease it could not be obtained , Still greater pleasure he would then have gained . GO preach me this to silly country louts ; These , howsoe'er , had managed well their bouts , It must not be denied , and all was nice ; To do the like perhaps ` twill some entice . I much regret my lot was not the same , Though doubtless many will my wishes blame .
