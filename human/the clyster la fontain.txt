THE CLYSTER La Fontain IF truth give pleasure , surely we should try ; To found our tales on what we can rely ; Th ' experiment repeatedly I 've made , And seen how much realities persuade : They draw attention : confidence awake ; Fictitious names however we should take , And then the rest detail without disguise : ` Tis thus I mean to manage my supplies . IT happened then near Mans , a Normand town , For sapient people always of renown , A maid not long ago a lover had Brisk , pleasing , ev ` ry way a handsome lad ; The down as yet was scarcely on his chin ; The girl was such as many wished to win : Had charms and fortune , all that was desired , And by the Mansian sparks was much admired ; Around they swarmed , but vain was all their art Too much our youth possessed the damsel 's heart . THE parents , in their wisdom , meant the fair Should marry one who was a wealthy heir ; But she contrived to manage matters well ; In spite of ev ` ry thing which might repel , -LRB-B- I know not how -RRB-B- at length he had access ; Though whether through indulgence or address , It matters not : perhaps his noble blood Might work a change when fully understood : The LUCKY , ev ` ry thing contrives to please ; The rest can nothing but misfortune seize . THE lover had success ; the parents thought His merit such as prudence would have sought ; What more to wish ? -- the miser 's hoarded store : The golden age 's wealth is now no more , A silly shadow , phantom of the brain ; O happy time ! I see indeed with pain , Thou wilt return : -- in MAINE thou shalt arise ; Thy innocence , we fondly may surmise , Had seconded our lover 's ardent flame , And hastened his possession of the dame . THE slowness usually in parents found , Induced the girl , whose heart by LOVE was bound ; To celebrate the Hymeneal scene , As in the statutes of Cythera 's queen . Our legendary writers this define A present contract , where they nothing sign ; The thing is common ; -- marriage made in haste : LOVE 'S perparation : Hymen 's bit for taste . NOT much examination Cupid made , As parent , lawyer , priest , he lent his aid , And soon concluded matters as desired ; The Mansian wisdom no ways was required . OUR spark was satisfied , and with his belle , Passed nights so happy , nothing could excel ; ` Twere easy to explain ; -- the double keys , And gifts designed the chambermaid to please , Made all secure , and ev ` ry joy abound ; The soft delights with secrecy were crowned . IT happened that our fair one evening said , To her who of each infant step had led , But of the present secret nothing knew : -- I feel unwell ; pray tell me what to do . The other answered , you my dear must take A remedy that easily I 'll make , A clyster you shall have to-morrow morn : By me most willingly it will be borne . WHEN midnight came the sly gallant appeared , Unluckily no doubt , but he revered The moments that so pleasantly were passed , Which always seemed , he thought , to glide too fast ; Relief he sought , for ev ` ry one below Is destined torments more or less to know . He not a word was told of things designed , And just as our gallant to sleep inclined , As oft 's the case at length with lovers true , Quite open bright Aurora 's portals flew , And with a smile the aged dame arrived ; The apparatus properly contrived , Was in her hand , she hastened to the bed , And took the side that to the stripling led . OUR lady fair was instantly confused , Or she precaution properly had used , 'Twas easy to have kept a steady face , And ` neath the clothes the other 's head to place . Pass presently beyond the hidden swain , And t ` other side with rapid motion gain , A thing quite natural , we should suppose ; But fears o ` erpow ` red ; the frightened damsel chose To hide herself , then whispered her gallant , What mighty terrors made her bosom pant . The youth was sage , and coolly undertook To offer for her : -- t ` other ` gan to look , With spectacles on nose : soon all went right ; Adieu , she cried , and then withdrew from sight . Heav ` n guard her steps , and all conduct away , Whose presence secret friendships would betray : SHOULD this be thought a silly , idle tale ; -LRB-B- And that opinion may perhaps prevail -RRB-B- To censure me , enough will surely try , For criticks are severe , and these will cry , Your lady like a simpleton escaped ; Her character you better might have shaped ; Which makes us doubt the truth of what is told : Naught in your prologue like it we behold . ` TWERE sueless to reply : ` twould endless prove : No arguments such censurers could move ; On men like these , devoid of sense or taste , In vain might Cicero his rhet ` rick waste . Sufficient ` tis for me , that what is here , I got from those who ev ` ry-where appear The friends of truth : -- let others say the same ; What more would they expect should be my aim ?
