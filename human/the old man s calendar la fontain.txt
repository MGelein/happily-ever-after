THE OLD MAN 'S CALENDAR La Fontain OFT have I seen in wedlock with surprise , That most forgot from which true bliss would rise When marriage for a daughter is designed , The parents solely riches seem to mind ; All other boons are left to heav ` n above , And sweet SIXTEEN must SIXTY learn to love ! Yet still in other things they nicer seem , Their chariot-horses and their oxen-team Are truly matched ; -- in height exact are these , While those each shade alike must have to please ; Without the choice ` twere wonderful to find , Or coach or wagon travel to their mind . The marriage journey full of cares appears , When couples match in neither souls nor years ! An instance of the kind I 'll now detail : The feeling bosom will such lots bewail ! QUINZICA , -LRB-B- Richard -RRB-B- , as the story goes , Indulged his wife at balls , and feasts , and shows , Expecting other duties she 'd forget , In which howe'er he disappointment met . A judge in Pisa , Richard was , it seems , In law most learned : wily in his schemes ; But silver beard and locks too clearly told , He ought to have a wife of diff ` rent mould ; Though he had taken one of noble birth , Quite young , most beautiful , and formed for mirth , Bartholomea Galandi her name ; The lady 's parents were of rank and fame ; Our JUDGE herein had little wisdom shown , And sneering friends around were often known To say , his children ne'er could fathers lack : At giving counsel some have got a knack , Who , were they but at home to turn their eyes , Might find , perhaps , they 're not so over-wise . QUINZICA , then perceiving that his pow ` rs Fell short of what a bird like his devours , T ` excuse himself and satisfy his dear , Pretended that , no day within the year , To Hymen , as a saint , was e ` er assigned , In calendar , or book of any kind , When full ATTENTION to the god was paid : -- To aged sires a nice convenient aid ; But this the sex by no means fancy right ; Few days to PLEASURE could his heart invite At times , the week entire he 'd have a fast ; At others , say the day ` mong saints was classed , Though no one ever heard its holy name ; -- FAST ev ` ry Friday -- Saturday the same , Since Sunday followed , consecrated day ; Then Monday came : -- still he 'd abstain from play ; Each morning find excuse , but solemn feasts Were days most sacred held by all the priests ; On abstinence , then , Richard lectures read , And long before the time , was always led By sense of right , from dainties to refrain : A period afterward would also gain ; The like observed before and after Lent ; And ev ` ry feast had got the same extent ; These times were gracious for our aged man ; And never pass them was his constant plan . OF patron saints he always had a list ; Th ' evangelists , apostles , none he miss 'd ; And that his scruples might have constant food ; Some days malign , he said , were understood ; Then foggy weather ; -- dog-days ' fervent heat : To seek excuses he was most complete , And ne'er asham 'd but manag 'd things so well , Four times a year , by special grace , they tell , Our sage regal 'd his youthful blooming wife , A little with the sweets of marriage life . WITH this exception he was truly kind , Fine dresses , jewels , all to please her mind ; But these are bawbles which alone controul Those belles , like dolls , mere bodies void of soul . Bartholomea was of diff ` rent clay ; Her only pleasure -LRB-B- as our hist ` ries say -RRB-B- , To go in summer to the neighb ` ring coast , Where her good spouse a charming house could boast , In which they took their lodging once a week ; At times they pleasure on the waves would seek , As fishing with the lady would agree , And she was wond ` rous partial to the sea , Though far to sail they always would refuse . One day it happened better to amuse , Our couple diff ` rent fishing vessels took , And skimm 'd the wave to try who most could hook , Of fish and pleasure ; and they laid a bet , The greatest number which of them should get . On board they had a man or two at most . And each the best adventure hop 'd to boast . A CERTAIN pirate soon observ 'd the ship , In which this charming lady made the trip , And presently attack 'd and seiz 'd the same ; But Richard 's bark to shore in safety came ; So near the land , or else he would not brave , To any great extent , the stormy wave , Or that the robber thought if both he took , He could not decently for favors look , And he preferr 'd those joys the FAIR bestow , To all the riches which to mortals flow . ALTHOUGH a pirate , he had always shown Much honor in his acts , as well was known ; But Cupid 's frolicks were his heart 's delight : None truly brave can ever beauty slight ; A sailor 's always bold and kind and free , Good lib ` ral fellows , such they 'll ever be ; ` Mong saints indeed ` twere vain their names to seek ! The man was good howe'er of whom we speak ; His usual name was Pagamin Montegue ; For hours the lady 's screams were heard a league , While he each minute anxiously would seize , To cheer her spirits and her heart to please ; T ` attain his wish he ev ` ry art combined ; At length the lovely captive all resigned . 'Twas Cupid conquer 'd , Cupid with his dart ; A thousand times more pirate in his art , Than Pagamin ; on bleeding hearts he preys , But little quarter gives , nor grace displays : To pay her ransom she 'd enough of gold ; For this her spouse was truly never cold ; No fast nor festival therein appear 'd , And her captivity he greatly fear 'd . THIS calendar o ` erspread with rubrick days ; She soon forgot and learn 'd the pirate 's ways ; The matrimonial zone aside was thrown , And only mentioned where the fact was known : OUR lawyer would his fingers sooner burn ; Than have his wife but virtuous home return ; By means of gold he entertain 'd no doubt , Her restoration might be brought about . A passport from the pirate he obtain 'd , Then waited on him and his wish explain 'd ; To pay he offer 'd what soe'er he 'd ask ; His terms accept , though hard perhaps the task ; THE robber answer 'd , if my name around , Be not for honorable acts renown 'd , ` Tis quite unjust : -- your partner I 'll restore In health , without a ransom : -- would you more ? A friendship so respect 'd , heav ` n forefend ! Should ever , by my conduct , have an end . The fair , whom you so ardently admire , Shall to your arms return as you desire , Such pleasure to a friend I would not sell ; Convince me that she 's your 's , and all is well ; For if another I to you should give , -LRB-B- And many that I 've taken with me live , -RRB-B- I surely should incur a heavy blame ; I lately captur 'd one , a charming dame , With auburn locks , a little fat , tall , young ; If she declare she does to you belong , When you she 's seen , I will the belle concede ; You 'll take her instantly ; I 'll not impede . THE sage replied , your conduct 's truly wise ; Such wond ` rous kindness fills me with surprise ; But since ` tis said that every trade must live , The sum just mention : -- I 'll the ransom give ; No compliment I wish , my purse behold You know the money presently is told ; Consider me a stranger now I pray ; With you I 'd equal probity display , And so will act , I swear , as you shall see ; There 's not a doubt the fair will go with me ; My word for this I would not have you take : -- You 'll see how happy ` twill the lady make To find me here ; to my embrace she 'll fly ; My only fears -- that she of joy will die . To them the charmer now was instant brought , Who eyed her husband as beneath a thought ; Received him coldly , just as if he 'd been A stranger from Peru , she ne'er had seen . LOOK , said Quinzica , she 's ashamed ` tis plain So many lookers on her love restrain ; But be assured , if we were left alone , Around my neck her arms would soon be thrown . IF this , replied the pirate , you believe , Attend her toilet : -- naught can then deceive . Away they went , and closely shut the door ; When Richard said , thou darling of my store , How can ` st thou thus behave ? my pretty dove , ` Tis thy Quinzica , come to seek his love , In all the same , except about his wife ; Dost in this face a change observe my life ? ` Tis grieving for thy loss that makes me ill ; Did ever I in aught deny thy will ? In dress or play could any thee exceed ? And had ` st thou not whatever thou might ` st need ? To please thee , oft I made myself a slave ; Such thou art now ; but thee again I crave . Then what dost think about thy honor , dear ? -- Said she , with ire , I neither know nor fear ; Is this a time to guard it , do you say ? What pain was shown by any one , I pray ; When I was forc 'd to wed a man like you , Old , impotent , and hateful to the view , While I was young and blooming as the morn , Deserving truly , something less forlorn , And seemingly intended to possess What Hymen best in store has got to bless ; For I was thought by all the world around , Most worthy ev ` ry bliss in wedlock found . YET things took quite another turn with me In tune my husband never proved to be , Except a feast or two throughout the year ; From Pagamin I met a diff ` rent cheer ; Another lesson presently he taught ; The life 's sweet pleasures more the pirate brought , In two short days , than e ` er I had from you In those four years that only you I knew . PRAY leave me husband : -- let me have my will Insist not on my living with you still ; No calendars with Pagamin are seen -- Far better treated with the man I 've been . My other friends and you much worse deserved : The spouse , for taking me when quite unnerved , And they , for giving preference base to gold , To those pure joys -- far better thought than told . But Pagamin in ev ` ry way can please ; And though no code he owns , yet all is ease ; Himself will tell you what has passed this morn , His actions would a sov ` reign prince adorn . Such information may excite surprise , But now the truth , ` twere useless to disguise , Nothing will gain belief , we 've no one near To witness our discourse : -- adieu , my dear , To all your festivals -- I 'm flesh and blood : -- Gems , dresses , ornaments , do little good ; You know full well , betwixt the head and heel , Though little 's said , yet much we often feel . On this she stopt , and Richard dropt his chin , Rejoiced to ` scape from such unwelcome din . BARTHOLOMEA , pleased with what had passed ; No disposition showed to hold him fast ; The downcast husband felt such poignant grief , With ills where age can scarcely hope relief , That soon he left this busy stage of life , And Pagamin the widow took to wife . The deed was just , for neither of the two E ` er felt what oft in Richard rose to view ; From feeling proof arose their mutual choice ; And ` tween them ne'er was heard the jarring voice . BEHOLD a lesson for the aged man ; Who thinks , when old , to act as he began ; But , if the sage a yielding dotard seems , His work is done by those the wife esteems ; Complaints are never heard ; no thrilling fears ; And ev ` ry one around at ease appears .
