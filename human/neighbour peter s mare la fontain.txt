NEIGHBOUR PETER 'S MARE La Fontain A CERTAIN pious rector -LRB-B- John his name -RRB-B- , But little preached , except when vintage came ; And then no preparation he required On this he triumphed and was much admired . Another point he handled very well , Though oft ` ner he 'd thereon have liked to dwell , And this the children of the present day , So fully know , there 's naught for me to say : John to the senses things so clearly brought , That much by wives and husbands he was sought , Who held his knowledge of superior price , And paid attention to his sage advice . Around , whatever conscience he might find , To soft delights and easy ways inclined , In person he would rigidly attend , And seek to act the confessor and friend ; Not e ` en his curate would he trust with these ; But zealously he tried to give them ease , And ev ` ry where would due attention show , Observing that divines should always know Their flocks most thoroughly and visit round ; To give instruction and the truth expound . AMONG the folks , to whom he visits paid , Was neighbor Peter , one who used the spade ; A villager that God , in lieu of lands , Had furnished only with a pair of hands , To dig and delve , and by the mattock gain Enough his wife and children to maintain . Still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace ; The weather injured solely had her face , But not the features which were perfect yet : Some wish perhaps more blooming belles to get ; The rustick truly me would ne'er have pleased ; But such are oft by country parsons seized , Who low amours and dishes coarse admire , That palates more refined would not desire . THE pastor John would often on her leer , just as a cur , when store of bones are near , That would good pickings for his teeth afford , Attentively behold the precious hoard , And seem uneasy ; move his feet and tail ; Now prick his ears ; then fear he ca n't prevail , The eyes still fixed upon the bite in sight , Which twenty times to these affords delight , Ere to his longing jaws the boon arrives , However anxiously the suitor strives . SELF-TORMENTS solely parson John obtained ; By seeing her that o ` er his senses reigned . The village-wife was innocent of this , And never dreamed of any thing amiss ; The pastor 's mystick looks , nor flatt ` ring ways ; Nor presents , aught in Magdalene could raise ; But nosegays made of thyme , and marj ` ram too , Were dropt on ground , or never kept in view ; A hundred little cares appeared as naught 'Twas Welch to her , and ne'er conveyed a thought . A pleasant stratagem he now contrived , From which , he hoped , success might be derived . MOST clearly Peter was a heavy lout , Yet truly I could never have a doubt , That rashly he would ne'er himself commit , Though folly ` twere from him to look for wit , Or aught expect by questioning to find ` Yond this to reason , he was not designed . THE rector to him said , thou ` rt poor , my friend , And hast not half enough for food to spend , With other things that necessary prove , If we below with comfort wish to move . Some day I 'll show thee how thou may ` st procure The means that will thy happiness insure , And make thee feel contented as a king . To me what present for it wilt thou bring ? ZOOKS ! Peter answered , parson , I desire , You 'll me direct to do as you require ; My labor pray command ; ` tis all I 've got ; Our pig howe'er to you we can allot , We want it not ; and truly it has eat More bran than thrice this vessel would complete ; The cow you 'll take besides , from which my wife A calf expects , to raise the means of life . No , no , the pastor with a smile replied , A recompense for this thou ` lt not provide ; My neighbor to oblige is all I heed ; And now I 'll tell thee how thou must proceed ; Thy spouse , by magick , I 'll transform each day , And turn her to a mare for cart or dray , And then again restore her ev ` ry night , To human form to give thy heart delight . From this to thee great profit will arise ; Thy ass , so slow is found , that when supplies , It carries to the market , ` tis so late , The hour is almost past ere at the gate , And then thy cabbages , and herbs , and roots , Provisions , provender , and wares and fruits , Remain unsold , and home to spoil are brought , Since rarely far from thence such things are sought . But when thy wife 's a mare , she 'll faster go : Strong , active , ev ` ry way her worth she 'll show , And home will come without expense in meat : No soup nor bread , but solely herbs she 'll eat : SAID Peter , parson , clearly you are wise ; From learning , what advantages arise ! Is this pray sold ? -- If I 'd much money got , To make the purchase I 'd the cash allot . CONTINUED John : -- now I will thee instruct , The proper manner , matters to conduct , For thee to have a clever mare by day , And still at night a charming wife survey ; Face , legs , and ev ` ry thing shall reappear ; Come , see it done , and I 'll perform it here ; Thou ` lt then the method fully comprehend ; But hold thy tongue , or all will quickly end : A single word the magick would dispel , And , during life , no more with us ` twould dwell . Keep close thy mouth and merely ope ' thy eyes : A glimpse alone to learn it will suffice ; This o ` er , thyself shall practice it the same , And all will follow as when first it came . THE husband promised he would hold his tongue ; And John disliked deferring matters long . Come , Magdalene , said he , you will undress ; To quit those Sunday-clothes , you 'll acquiesce , And put yourself in Nature 's pure array Well , well , proceed ; with stays and sleeves away ; That 's better still ; now petticoats lay by ; How nicely with my orders you comply . WHEN Magdalene was to the linen come , Some marks of shame around her senses swum ; A wife to live and die was her desire , Much rather than be seen in Eve 's attire ; She vowed that , spite of what the priest disclosed ; She never would consent to be exposed . SAID Peter , pretty work , upon my truth : -- Not let us see how you are made forsooth ! What silly scruples ! -- Are they in your creed ? You were not always led such scenes to heed : Pray how d'ye manage when for fleas you seek ? ` Tis strange , good sir , that she should be so weak ; What can you fear ? -- ` tis folly time to waste ; He will not eat you : come , I say , make haste : Have done with haggling ; had you acted right , Ere now the parson all had finished quite . ON saying this , her garment off he took ; Put on his spectacles to overlook ; And parson John , without delay , began ; Said he -LRB-B- as o ` er her person now he ran -RRB-B- , This part umbilical will make the mare A noble breast , and strength at once declare : Then further on the pastor placed his hand , While , with the other , -LRB-B- as a magick wand , -RRB-B- He set about transforming mounts of snow ; That in our climes a genial warmth bestow , And semi-globes are called , while those that rise In t ` other hemisphere , of larger size , Are seldom mentioned , through respect no doubt , But these howe'er the parson , quite devout , Would not neglect , and whatsoe'er he felt , He always named , and on its beauties dwelt ; The ceremony this , it seems , required , And fully ev ` ry movement John admired . PROCEEDINGS so minute gave Peter pain , And as he could not see the rector gain The slightest change , he prayed the pow ` rs divine , To give assistance to the priest 's design ; But this was vain , since all the magick spell , In metamorphosing the lady well , Depended on the fixing of the tail ; Without this ornament the whole would fail . To set it on the parson hastened now , When Neighbour Peter ` gan to knit his brow , And bawled so loud , you might have heard him far : No tail , said he , I 'll have : there 'll be a scar ; You put it on too low ; but vain his cries , The husband 's diligence would not suffice , For , spite of ev ` ry effort , much was done , And John completely his career had run , If Peter had not pulled the rector 's gown , Who hastily replied , thou ninny , clown ; Did I not tell thee silence to observe , And not a footstep from thy station swerve ? The whole is spoiled , insufferable elf ! And for it thou hast got to thank thyself . THE husband , while the holy pastor spoke , Appeared to grumble and his stars invoke . The wife was in a rage , and ` gan to scold : Said she to Peter , wretch that I behold ! Thou ` lt be through life a prey to pain and grief , Come not to me and bray and hope relief , The worthy pastor would have us procured The means that might much comfort have ensured . Can he deserve such treatment to receive ? Good Mister John this goose I now would leave , And ev ` ry morning , while he gathers fruits , Or plants , herbs , cabbages , and various roots , Without averting him , pray , here repair , You 'll soon transform me to a charming mare . No mare , replied the husband , I desire ; An ass for me is all that I require .
