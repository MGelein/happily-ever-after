THE EEL PIE La Fontain HOWEVER exquisite we BEAUTY find , It satiates sense , and palls upon the mind : Brown bread as well as white must be for me ; My motto ever is -- VARIETY . THAT brisk brunette , with languid , sleepy eye , Delights my fancy ; Can you tell me why ? The reason 's plain enough : -- she 's something new . The other mistress , long within my view , Though lily fair , with seraph features blessed , No more emotion raises in my breast ; Her heart assents , while mine reluctant proves ; Whence this diversity that in us moves ? From hence it rises , to be plain and free , My motto ever is -- VARIETY . THE same in other words , I 've often said ; ` Tis right , at times , disguise with care to spread . The maxim 's good , and with it I agree : My motto ever is -- VARIETY . A CERTAIN spouse the same devise had got , Whose wife by all was thought a handsome lot . His love , howe'er , was over very soon ; It lasted only through the honeymoon ; Possession had his passion quite destroyed ; In Hymen 's bands too oft the lover 's cloyed . ONE , ` mong his valets , had a pretty wife ; The master was himself quite full of life , And soon the charmer to his wishes drew , With which the husband discontented grew , And having caught them in the very fact , He rang his mate the changes for the act ; Sad names he called her , howsoever just , A silly blockhead ! thus to raise a dust , For what , in ev ` ry town 's so common found ; May we worse fortune never meet around ! HE made the paramor a grave harangue Do n't others give , said he , the poignant pang ; But ev ` ry one allow to keep his own , As God and reason oft to man have shown , And recommended fully to observe ; You from it surely have not cause to swerve ; You can not plead that you for beauty pine You 've one at home who far surpasses mine ; No longer give yourself such trouble , pray : You , to my help-mate , too much honor pay ; Such marked attentions she can ne'er require Let each of us , alone his own admire . To others ' WELLs you never ought to go , While your 's with sweets is found to overflow ; I willingly appeal to connoisseurs ; If heav ` n had blessed me with such bliss as your 's , That when I please , your lady I could take , I would not for a queen such charms forsake . But since we ca n't prevent what now is known , I wish , good sir , contented with your own , -LRB-B- And ` tis , I hope , without offence I speak , -RRB-B- You 'll favors from my wife no longer seek . THE master , neither no nor yes replied , But orders gave , his man they should provide ; For dinner ev ` ry day , what pleased his taste , A pie of eels , which near him should be placed . HIS appetite at first was wond ` rous great ; Again , the second time , as much he ate ; But when the third appeared , he felt disgust , And not another morsel down could thrust . The valet fain would try a diff ` rent dish ; 'Twas not allowed ; -- you 've got , said they , your wish ; ` Tis pie alone ; you like it best you know , And no objection you must dare to show . I 'M surfeited , cried he , ` tis far too much : Pie ev ` ry day ! and nothing else to touch ! Not e ` en a roasted eel , or stewed , or fried ! Dry bread I 'd rather you 'd for me provide . Of your 's allow me some at any rate , Pies , -LRB-B- devil take them ! -RRB-B- thoroughly I hate ; They 'll follow me to Paradise I fear , Or further yet ; -- Heav ` n keep me from such cheer ! THEIR noisy mirth the master thither drew , Who much desired the frolick to pursue ; My friend , said he , I greatly feel surprise , That you so soon are weary grown of pies ; Have I not heard you frequently declare , Eel-pie 's of all , the most delicious fare ? Quite fickle , certainly , must be your taste ; Can any thing in me so strange be traced ? When I exchange a food which you admire ; You blame and say , I never ought to tire ; You do the very same ; in truth , my friend , No mark of folly ` tis , you may depend , In lord or squire , or citizen or clown , To change the bread that 's white for bit of brown : With more experience , you 'll with me agree , -- My motto ever is -- VARIETY . WHEN thus the master had himself expressed , The valet presently was less distressed ; Some arguments , howe'er , at first he used ; For , after all -- are fully we excused , When we our pleasure solely have in view ; Without regarding what 's to others due ? I relish change ; well , take it ; but ` tis best , To gain the belles with love of gold possessed ; And that appears to me the proper plan ; In truth , our lover very soon began To practice this advice ; -- his voice and way Could angel-sweetness instantly convey . HIS words were always gilt ; -LRB-B- impressive tongue ! -RRB-B- To gilded words will sure success belong . In soft amours they 're ev ` ry thing ` tis plain The maxim 's certain , and our aim will gain ; My meaning doubtless easily is seen ; A hundred times repeated this has been Th ' impression should be made so very deep , That I thereon can never silence keep ; And this the constant burden of my song -- To gilded words will sure success belong . THEY easily persuade the beauteous dame ; Her dog , her maid , duenna , all the same ; The husband sometimes too , and him we 've shown 'Twas necessary here to gain alone ; By golden eloquence his soul was lulled ; Although from ancient orators not culled : Their books retained have nothing of the kind ; Our jealous spouse indulgent grew we find . He followed e ` en , ` tis said , the other 's plan -- And , thence his dishes to exchange began . THE master and his fav ` rite 's freaks around ; Continually the table-talk were found ; He always thought the newest face the best : Where'er he could , each beauty he caressed ; The wife , the widow , daughter , servant-maid , The nymph of field or town : -- with all he played ; And , while he breathed , the same would always be ; His motto ever was -- VARIETY .
