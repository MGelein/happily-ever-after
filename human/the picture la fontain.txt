THE PICTURE La Fontain SOLICITED I 've been to give a tale , In which -LRB-B- though true , decorum must prevail -RRB-B- , The subject from a picture shall arise , That by a curtain 's kept from vulgar eyes . My brain must furnish various features new : What 's delicate and smart produce to view ; By this expressed , and not by t ` other said : And all so clear , most easy to be read , By ev ` ry fool , without the aid of notes , That idiot 's bad indeed who never quotes . CATULLUS tells us , ev ` ry matron sage Will peep most willingly -LRB-B- whate'er her age -RRB-B- , At that gigantick gift , which Juno made , To Venus ' fruit , in gardens oft displayed . If any belle recede , and shun the sight , Dissimulation she supposes right . THIS principle allowed , why scruples make ? Why , less than eyes , should ears a license take ? But since ` tis so resolved I 'll do my best , And naught in open terms shall be expressed : A veil shall over ev ` ry charm be cast , Of gauze indeed , and this from first to last , So nicely done , that howsoever tost , To none I trust will any thing be lost . Who nicely thinks , and speaks with graceful ease ; Can current make just whatsoe'er he please ; For all will pass , as I have often known : The word well chosen , pardon soon is shown , The sex o ` erlook the thing no more the same , The thought remains , but ` tis without a name ; No blush is raised ; no difficulty found ; Yet ev ` ry body understands around . AT present , much I need this useful art : Why ? you will ask ; because , when I impart Such wondrous circumstances , ev ` ry belle , Without reserve , will con them over well . To this I answer : female ears are chaste , Though roguish are their eyes , as well as taste . BE that as ` twill , I certainly should like , With freedom to explain , by terms oblique , To belles , how this was broken : -- that was down : Assist me pray , ye NINE of high renown ; But you are maids , and strangers , we agree , To LOVE 'S soft scenes , not knowing A from B. Remain then , Muses , never stir an inch , But beg the god of verse , when at a pinch , To help me out and kind assistance lend , To choose expressions which will not offend , Lest I some silly things should chance to say , That might displeasure raise , and spoil my lay . Enough , howe'er , we 've on the subject said : ` Tis time we t ` wards the painting should be led , Which an adventure you will find contains , That happened once in Cupid 's famed domains . IN former days , just by Cythera town A monastery was , of some renown , With nuns the queens of beauty filled the place , And gay gallants you easily might trace . The courtier , citizen , and parson too , The doctor and the bachelor you 'd view , With eager steps : -- all visits thither made ; And ` mong the latter , one -LRB-B- a pleasing blade -RRB-B- Had free access : was thought a prudent friend , Who might to sisters many comforts lend ; Was always closely shaved and nicely dressed ; And ev ` ry thing he said was well expressed ; The breath of scandal , howsoever pat , Ne'er lighted on his neat cravat nor hat . TWO nuns alternatively , from the youth ; Experienced many services , in truth ; The one had recently a novice been ; Few months had passed since she complete was seen ; The other still the dress of novice wore ; The youngest 's age was seventeen years , not more Time doubtless very proper -LRB-B- to be plain -RRB-B- Love 's wily thesis fully to sustain : The bachelor so well the fair had taught , And they so earnestly the science sought , That by experience both the art had learned , And ev ` ry thing most perfectly discerned . THESE sisters eagerly had made one day An assignation with the lover gay ; To have the entertainment quite complete , They 'd Bacchus , Ceres too , who Venus greet : With perfect neatness all the meats were served , And naught from grace and elegancy swerved ; The wines , the custards , jellies , creams , and ice : The decorations , ev ` ry thing was nice ; What pleasing objects and delights were viewed ! The room with sweetest flow ` rs fair Flora strewed ; A sort of garden o ` er the linen traced Here lakes of love : -- there names entwined were placed ; Magnificence like this the nuns admired , And such amusements ardently desired . Their beauty too incited to be free ; A thousand matters filled their souls with glee ; In height the belles were pretty much the same Like alabaster fair ; of perfect frame ; In num ` rous corners Cupid nestling lay : Beneath a stomacher he 'd slyly play , A veil or scapulary , this or that , Where least the eye of day perceived he sat , Unless a lover called to mystick bow ` rs , Where he might hearts entwine with chains of flow ` rs ; A thousand times a day the urchin flew , With open arms the sisters to pursue ; Their charms were such in ev ` ry air and look , Both -LRB-B- one by one -RRB-B- he for his mother took . WITH anxious looks , the ladies thus prepared , Expected him who all their kindness shared ; Now they bestowed abuse ; next fondly praised : Then of his conduct dark suspicions raised , Conceived , a new amour him kept away : What can it be , said one , that makes him stay ? Of honor an affair . -- love -- sickness -- what ? Said t ` other whether it be this or that , If here again his face he ever show , A pretty trick in turn we 'll let him know . WHILE thus the couple sought their plot to frame , A convent porter with a burden came , For her who kept the stores of ev ` ry kind , Depositary of the whole designed . 'Twas merely a pretence , as I am told : The things were not required for young or old ; But she much appetite had got in truth , Which made her have recourse to such a youth , Who was regarded , in repasts like these , A first rate cook that all prepared at ease . THIS awkward , heavy lout mistook the cell ; By chance upon our ladies ' room he fell , And knocked with weighty hands : they ope 'd the door . And gave abuse , but soon their anger o ` er , The nuns conceived a treasure they had found , And , laughing heartily , no longer frowned , But both exclaimed at once : let 's take this fool ; Of him we easily can make a tool ; As well as t ` other , do n't you think he 'll do ? The eldest added : -- let 's our whim pursue ; ` Tis well determined ; -- What were we to get , That here we waited , and are waiting yet ? Fine words and phrases ; nothing of the kind ; This wight 's as good , for what we have a mind , As any bachelor or doctor wise At all events , for present , he 'll suffice . SHE rightly judged ; his height , form , simple air , And ev ` ry act , so clearly void of care , Raised expectation ; this was AEsop 's man , He never thought : 'twas all without a plan ; Both ate and drank , and , had he been at will , Would matters far have pushed , though void of skill . FAMILIAR grown , the fellow ready seemed , To execute whate'er was proper deemed ; To serve the convent he was porter made , And in their wishes nuns of course obeyed . ` TIS here begins the subject we 've in view , The scene that faithfully our painter drew ; Apollo , give me aid , assistance lend , Enable me , I pray , to comprehend , Why this mean stupid rustick sat at ease , And left the sisters -LRB-B- Claudia , formed to please , And lovely fair Theresa -RRB-B- all the care ? Had he not better done to give a chair ? I THINK I hear the god of verse reply : Not quite so fast my friend , you may rely , These matters never can the probe endure ; I understand you ; Cupid , to be sure , Is doubtless found a very roguish boy , Who , though he please at times , will oft annoy ; I 'm wrong a wicked whelp like this to take , And , master of the ceremonies make . NO sooner in a house the urchin gets , But rules and laws he at defiance sets ; The place of reason whim at once assumes , BreaksS ev ` ry obstacle , frets , rages , fumes . With scenes like these will Cupid oft surprise , And frantick passion sparkle in his eyes . SOON on the floor was seen this boorish wight ; For , whether that the chair was rather slight , Or that the composition of the clown Was not , like that of geese , of softest down , Or that Theresa , by her gay discourse , Had penetrated to the mystick source , The am ` rous pulpit suddenly gave way , And on the ground the rustick quickly lay . The first attempt had clearly bad success , And fair Theresa suffered you may guess . YE censors keep from hence your eyes prophane ; See , honest hearts , how Claudia tried amain , To take advantage of the dire mishap , And all she could , with eagerness entrap ; For in the fall Theresa lost her hold ; The other pushed her : -- further off she rolled ; And
