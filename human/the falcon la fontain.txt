THE FALCON La Fontain I RECOLLECT , that lately much I blamed , The sort of lover , avaricious named ; And if in opposites we reason see , The liberal in paradise should be . The rule is just and , with the warmest zeal , To prove the fact I to the CHURCH appeal . IN Florence once there dwelled a gentle youth , Who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth ; O'er all his actions she had full controul ; -- To please he would have sold his very soul . If she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold , Convinced in love or war you should be bold ; The cash ne'er spare : -- invincible its pow ` rs , O'erturning walls or doors where'er it show ` rs . The precious ore can every thing o ` ercome ; ` Twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb ; And these can render eloquent at will : -- Excel e ` en Tully in persuasive skill ; In short he 'd leave no quarter unsubdued , Unless therein the fair he could include . SHE stood th ' attack howe'er , and Frederick failed ; His force was vain whenever he assailed ; Without the least return his wealth he spent : Lands , houses , manors of immense extent , Were ev ` ry now and then to auction brought ; To gratify his love was all he thought . THE rank of ` squire till lately he had claimed ; Now scarcely was he even mister named ; Of wealth by Cupid 's stratagems bereft , A single farm was all the man had left ; Friends very few , and such as God alone , Could tell if friendship they might not disown ; The best were led their pity to express ; 'Twas all he got : it could not well be less ; To lend without security was wrong , And former favors they 'd forgotten long ; With all that Frederick could or say or do , His liberal conduct soon was lost to view . WITH Clytia he no longer was received , Than while he was a man of wealth believed ; Balls , concerts , op ` ras , tournaments , and plays , Expensive dresses , all engaging ways , Were used to captivate this lady fair , While scarcely one around but in despair , Wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought ; To gain him , ev ` ry wily art was brought ; But all in vain : -- by passion overpow ` red , The belle , whose conduct others would have soured , To him appeared a goddess full of charms , Superior e ` en to Helen , in his arms ; From whence we may conclude , the beauteous dame Was always deaf to Fred ` rick 's ardent flame . ENAMOURED of the belle , his lands he sold ; The family estates were turned to gold ; And many who the purchases had made , With pelf accumulated by their trade , Assumed the airs of men of noble birth : -- Fair subjects oft for ridicule and mirth ! RICH Clytia was , and her good spouse , ` tis said , Had lands which far and wide around were spread ; No cash nor presents she would ever take , Yet suffered Frederick splendid treats to make , Without designing recompense to grant , Or being more than merely complaisant . ALREADY , if my mem ` ry do not fail , I 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale , To pay for feasts the fair to entertain , And what he 'd left was only one domain , A petty farm to which he now retired ; Ashamed to show where once so much admired , And wretched too , a prey to lorn despair , Unable to obtain by splendid care , A beauty he 'd pursued six years and more , And should for ever fervently adore . His want of merit was the cause he thought , That she could never to his wish be brought , While from him not a syllable was heard , Against the lovely belle his soul preferred . ` MID poverty oft Fred ` rick sighed and wept ; A toothless hag -- his only servant kept ; His kitchen cold ; -LRB-B- where commonly he dwelled ; -RRB-B- A pretty decent horse his stable held ; A falcon too ; and round about the grange , Our quondam ` squire repeatedly would range , Where oft , to melancholy , he was led , To sacrifice the game which near him fed ; By Clytia 's cruelty the gun was seized , And feathered victims black chagrin appeased . 'TWAS thus the lover whiled his hours away ; His heart-felt torments nothing could allay ; Blessed if with fortune love he 'd also lost , Which constantly his earthly comforts crossed ; But this lorn passion preyed upon his mind : -- Where'er he rode , BLACK CARE would mount behind . DEATH took at length the husband of the fair ; An only son appointed was his heir , A sickly child , whose life , 'twas pretty plain , Could scarcely last till spring returned again , Which made the husband , by his will , decree , His wife the infant 's successor should be , In case the babe at early years should die , Who soon grew worse and raised the widow 's sigh . TOO much affection parents ne'er can show : -- A mother 's feelings none but mothers know . FAIR Clytia round her child with anxious care , Watched day and night , and no expense would spare ; Inquired if this or that would please his taste ; What he desired should be procured with haste ; But nothing would he have that she proposed ; An ardent wish howe'er the boy disclosed , For Fred ` rick 's Falcon , and most anxious grew : -- Tear followed tear , and nothing else would do . When once a child has got a whim in brain , No peace , no rest , till he the boon obtain . WE should observe our belle , near Fred ` rick 's cot , A handsome house and many lands had got ; 'Twas there the lovely babe had lately heard , Most wondrous stories of the bird averred ; No partridge e ` er escaped its rapid wing : -- On every morn down numbers it would bring ; No money for it would its owner take ; Much grieved was Clytia such request to make . The man , for her , of wealth had been bereft ; How ask the only treasure he had left ? And him if she were led to importune , Could she expect that he 'd accord the boon ? Alas ! ungratefully she oft repaid , His liberal treats , his concerts , serenade , And haughtily behaved from first to last : How be so bold , -LRB-B- reflecting on the past , -RRB-B- To see the man that she so ill had used ? And ask a favor ? -- could she be excused ? But then her child ! -- perhaps his life ` twould save ; Naught would he take ; the falcon she must crave . THAT her sweet babe might be induced to eat , So meant the bird of Fred ` rick to intreat ; Her boy was heard continually to cry , Unless he had the falcon , he should die . THESE reasons strongly with the mother weighed ; Her visit to the ` squire was not delayed ; With fond affection for her darling heir , One morn , alone she sought the lorn repair . TO Fred ` rick 's eye an angel she appeared ; But shame he felt , that she , his soul revered , Should find him poor : -- no servants to attend , Nor means to give a dinner to a friend . The poverty in which he now was viewed , Distressed his mind and all his griefs renewed . Why come ? said he ; what led you thus to trace , An humble slave of your celestial face ? A villager , a wretched being here ; Too great the honor doubtless must appear ; 'Twas somewhere else you surely meant to go ? The lady in a moment answered no. . Cried he , I 've neither cook nor kettle left ; Then how can I receive you , thus bereft ? But you have bread , said Clytia : -- that will do ; -- The lover quickly to the poultry flew , In search of eggs ; some bacon too he found ; But nothing else , except the hawk renowned , Which caught his eye , and instantly was seized , Slain , plucked , and made a fricassee that pleased . MEANWHILE the house-keeper for linen sought ; Knives , forks , plates , spoons , cups , glass and chairs she brought ; The fricassee was served , the dame partook , And on the dish with pleasure seemed to look . THE dinner o ` er , the widow then resolved , To ask the boon which in her mind resolved . She thus begun : -- good sir , you 'll think me mad , To come and to your breast fresh trouble add ; I 've much to ask , and you will feel surprise , That one , for whom your love could ne'er suffice , Should now request your celebrated bird ; Can I expect the grant ? -- the thought 's absurd But pardon pray a mother 's anxious fear ; ` Tis for my child : -- his life to me is dear . The falcon solely can the infant save ; Yet since to you I nothing ever gave , For all your kindness oft on me bestowed ; Your fortune wasted : -- e ` en your nice abode , Alas ! disposed of , large supplies to raise , To entertain and please in various ways : I can not hope this falcon to obtain ; For sure I am the expectation 's vane ; No , rather perish child and mother too ; Than such uneasiness should you pursue : Allow howe'er this parent , I beseech , Who loves her offspring ` yond the pow ` r of speech , Or language to express , her only boy , Sole hope , sole comfort , all her earthly joy , True mother like , to seek her child 's relief , And in your breast deposit now her grief . Affection 's pow ` r none better know than you , -- How few to love were ever half so true ! From such a bosom I may pardon crave Soft pity 's ever with the good and brave ! ALAS ! the wretched lover straight replied , The bird was all I could for you provide ; 'Twas served for dinner . -- Dead ? -- exclaimed the dame , While trembling terror overspread her frame . No jest , said he , and from the soul I wish , My heart , instead of that , had been the dish ; But doomed alas ! am I by fate , ` tis clear , To find no grace with her my soul holds dear : I 'd nothing left ; and when I saw the bird , To kill it instantly the thought occurred ; Those naught we grudge nor spare to entertain , Who o ` er our feeling bosoms sov ` reign reign : All I can do is speedily to get , Another falcon : easily they 're met ; And by to-morrow I 'll the bird procure . No , Fred ` rick , she replied , I now conjure You 'll think no more about it ; what you 've done Is all that fondness could have shown a son ; And whether fate has doomed the child to die , Or with my prayers the pow ` rs above comply ; For you my gratitude will never end -- Pray let us hope to see you as a friend . THEN Clytia took her leave , and gave her hand ; A proof his love no more she would withstand . He kissed and bathed her fingers with his tears ; The second day grim death confirmed their fears : THE mourning lasted long and mother 's grief ; But days and months at length bestowed relief ; No wretchedness so great , we may depend , But what , to time 's all-conqu ` ring sithe will bend : TWO famed physicians managed with such care ; That they recovered her from wild despair , And tears gave place to cheerfulness and joy : -- The one was TIME the other Venus ' Boy . Her hand fair Clytia on the youth bestowed , As much from love as what to him she owed . LET not this instance howsoe ` r mislead ; ` Twere wrong with hope our fond desires to feed , And waste our substance thus : -- not all the FAIR , Possess of gratitude a decent share . With this exception they appear divine ; In lovely WOMAN angel-charms combine ; The whole indeed I do not here include ; Alas ; too many act the jilt and prude . When kind , they 're ev ` ry blessing found below : When otherwise a curse we often know .
