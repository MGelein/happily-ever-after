THE DRESS-MAKER La Fontain A CLOISTERED nun had a lover Dwelling in the neighb ` ring town ; Both racked their brains to discover How they best their love might crown . The swain to pass the convent-door ! -- No easy matter ! -- Thus they swore , And wished it light . -- I ne'er knew a nun In such a pass to be outdone : -- In woman 's clothes the youth must dress , And gain admission . I confess The ruse has oft been tried before , But it succeeded as of yore . Together in a close barred cell The lovers were , and sewed all day , Nor heeded how time flew away . -- `` What 's that I hear ? Refection bell ! '' ` Tis time to part . Adieu ! -- Farewell ! -- `` How 's this ? '' exclaimed the abbess , `` why `` The last at table ? '' -- `` Madam , I `` Have had my dress-maker . '' -- `` The rent `` On which you 've both been so intent `` Is hard to stop , for the whole day `` To sew and mend , you made her stay ; `` Much work indeed you 've had to do ! '' -- Madam , ` t would last the whole night through , `` When in our task we find enjoyment `` There is no end of the employment . ''
