THE PIE AND THE PATTY-PAN Beatrix Potter Pussy-cat sits by the fire -- how should she be fair ? In walks the little dog -- says `` Pussy are you there ? How do you do mistress Pussy ? Mistress Pussy , how do you do ? '' `` I thank you kindly , little dog , I fare as well as you ! '' Old Rhyme . ONCE upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby , who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea . `` Come in good time , my dear Duchess , '' said Ribby 's letter , `` and we will have something so very nice . I am baking it in a pie-dish -- a pie - dish with a pink rim . You never tasted anything so good ! And YOU shall eat it all ! _ I _ will eat muffins , my dear DuchessS ! '' wrote Ribby . Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer : -- `` I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four . But it is very strange . _ I _ was just going to invite you to come here , to supper , my dear Ribby , to eat something MOST DELICIOUS . '' `` I will come very punctually , my dear Ribby , '' wrote Duchess ; and then at the end she added -- `` I hope it is n't mouse ? '' And then she thought that did not look quite polite ; so she scratched out `` is n't mouse '' and changed it to `` I hope it will be fine , '' and she gave her letter to the postman . But she thought a great deal about Ribby 's pie , and she read Ribby 's letter over and over again . `` I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse ! '' said Duchess to herself -- `` I really could n't , COULD N'T eat mouse pie . And I shall have to eat it , because it is a party . And MY pie was going to be veal and ham . A pink and white pie-dish ! and so is mine ; just like Ribby 's dishes ; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit 's . '' Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it
