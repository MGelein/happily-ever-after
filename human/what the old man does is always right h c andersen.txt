WHAT THE OLD MAN DOES IS ALWAYS RIGHT . H. C. Andersen I will tell you a story which was told to me when I was a little boy . Every time I thought of the story , it seemed to me to become more and more charming ; for it is with stories as it is with many people -- they become better as they grow older . I take it for granted that you have been in the country , and seen a very old farmhouse with a thatched roof , and mosses and small plants growing wild upon the thatch . There is a stork 's nest on the summit of the gable ; for we ca n't do without the stork . The walls of the house are sloping , and the windows are low , and only one of the latter is made so that it will open . The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a little fat body . The elder tree hangs over the paling , and beneath its branches , at the foot of the paling , is a pool of water in which a few ducks are disporting themselves . There is a yard-dog too , who barks at all comers . Just such a farmhouse stood out in the country ; and in this house dwelt an old couple -- a peasant and his wife . Small as was their property , there was one article among it that they could do without -- a horse , which made a living out of the grass it found by the side of the high-road . The old peasant rode into the town on this horse ; and often his neighbors borrowed it of him , and rendered the old couple some service in return for the loan of it . But they thought it would be best if they sold the horse , or exchanged it for something that might be more useful to them . But what might this _ something _ be ? `` You 'll know that best , old man , '' said the wife . `` It is fair-day to-day , so ride into town , and get rid of the horse for money , or make a good exchange : whichever you do will be right to me . Ride to the fair . '' And she fastened his neckerchief for him , for she could do that better than he could ; and she tied it in a double bow , for she could do that very prettily . Then she brushed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand , and gave him a kiss . So he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold or to be bartered for something else . Yes , the old man knew what he was about . The sun shone hotly down , and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky . The road was very dusty , for many people who were all bound for the fair were driving , or riding , or walking upon it . There was no shelter anywhere from the sunbeams . Among the rest , a man was trudging along , and driving a cow to the fair . The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow can be . `` She gives good milk , I 'm sure , '' said the peasant . `` That would be a very good exchange -- the cow for the horse . `` Hallo , you there with the cow ! '' he said ; `` I tell you what -- I fancy a horse costs more than a cow , but I do n't care for that ; a cow would be more useful to me . If you like , we 'll exchange . '' `` To be sure I will , '' said the man ; and they exchanged accordingly . So that was settled , and the peasant might have turned back , for he had done the business he came to do ; but as he had once made up his mind to go to the fair , he determined to proceed , merely to have a look at it ; and so he went on to the town with his cow . Leading the animal , he strode sturdily on ; and after a short time , he overtook a man who was driving a sheep . It was a good fat sheep , with a fine fleece on its back . `` I should like to have that fellow , '' said our peasant to himself . `` He would find plenty of grass by our palings , and in the winter we could keep him in the room with us . Perhaps it would be more practical to have a sheep instead of a cow . Shall we exchange ? '' The man with the sheep was quite ready , and the bargain was struck . So our peasant went on in the high-road with his sheep . Soon he overtook another man , who came into the road from a field , carrying a great goose under his arm . `` That 's a heavy thing you have there . It has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat , and would look well tied to a string , and paddling in the water at our place . That would be something for my old woman ; she could make all kinds of profit out of it . How often she has said , ` If we only had a goose ! ' Now , perhaps , she can have one ; and , if possible , it shall be hers . Shall we exchange ? I 'll give you my sheep for your goose , and thank you into the bargain . '' The other man had not the least objection ; and accordingly they exchanged , and our peasant became proprietor of the goose . By this time he was very near the town . The crowd on the high-road became greater and greater ; there was quite a crush of men and cattle . They walked in the road , and close by the palings ; and at the barrier they even walked into the toll-man 's potato-field , where his one fowl was strutting about , with a string to its leg , lest it should take fright at the crowd , and stray away , and so be lost . This fowl had short tail-feathers , and winked with both its eyes , and looked very cunning . `` Cluck , cluck ! '' said the fowl . What it thought when it said this I can not tell you ; but directly our good man saw it , he thought , `` That 's the finest fowl I 've ever seen in my life ! Why , it 's finer than our parson 's brood hen . On my word , I should like to have that fowl . A fowl can always find a grain or two , and can almost keep itself . I think it would be a good exchange if I could get that for my goose . `` Shall we exchange ? '' he asked the toll-taker . `` Exchange ! '' repeated the man ; `` well , that would not be a bad thing . '' And so they exchanged ; the toll-taker at the barrier kept the goose , and the peasant carried away the fowl . Now , he had done a good deal of business on his way to the fair , and he was hot and tired . He wanted something to eat , and a glass of brandy to drink ; and soon he was in front of the inn . He was just about to step in , when the hostler came out , so they met at the door . The hostler was carrying a sack . `` What have you in that sack ? '' asked the peasant . `` Rotten apples , '' answered the hostler ; `` a whole sackful of them -- enough to feed the pigs with . '' -LRB-B- Illustration : THE OLD MAN RELATES HIS SUCCESS . aaaaa -RRB-B- aaa `` Why , that 's terrible waste ! I should like to take them to my old woman at home . Last year the old tree by the turf-hole only bore a single apple , and we kept it on the cupboard till it was quite rotten and spoilt . ` It was always property , ' my old woman said ; but here she could see a quantity of property -- a whole sackful . Yes , I shall be glad to show them to her . '' `` What will you give me for the sackful ? '' asked the hostler . `` What will I give ? I will give my fowl in exchange . '' And he gave the fowl accordingly , and received the apples , which he carried into the guest-room . He leaned the sack carefully by the stove , and then went to the table . But the stove was hot : he had not thought of that . Many guests were present -- horse dealers , ox-herds , and two Englishmen -- and the two Englishmen were so rich that their pockets bulged out with gold coins , and almost burst ; and they could bet too , as you shall hear . Hiss-s-s ! hiss-s-s ! What was that by the stove ? The apples were beginning to roast ! `` What is that ? '' `` Why , do you know -- , '' said our peasant . And he told the whole story of the horse that he had changed for a cow , and all the rest of it , down to the apples . `` Well , your old woman will give it you well when you get home ! '' said one of the two Englishmen . `` There will be a disturbance . '' `` What ? -- give me what ? '' said the peasant . `` She will kiss me , and say , ` What the old man does is always right . ' '' `` Shall we wager ? '' said the Englishman . `` We 'll wager coined gold by the ton -- a hundred pounds to the hundredweight ! '' `` A bushel will be enough , '' replied the peasant . `` I can only set the bushel of apples against it ; and I 'll throw myself and my old woman into the bargain -- and I fancy that 's piling up the measure . '' `` Done -- taken ! '' And the bet was made . The host 's carriage came up , and the Englishmen got in , and the peasant got in ; away they went , and soon they stopped before the peasant 's hut . `` Good evening , old woman . '' `` Good evening , old man . '' `` I 've made the exchange . '' `` Yes , you understand what you 're about , '' said the woman . And she embraced him , and paid no attention to the stranger guests , nor did she notice the sack . `` I got a cow in exchange for the horse , '' said he . `` Heaven be thanked ! '' said she . `` What glorious milk we shall have , and butter and cheese on the table ! That was a capital exchange ! '' `` Yes , but I changed the cow for a sheep . '' `` Ah , that 's better still ! '' cried the wife . `` You always think of everything : we have just pasture enough for a sheep . Ewe 's - milk and cheese , and woollen jackets and stockings ! The cow can not give those , and her hairs will only come off . How you think of everything ! '' `` But I changed away the sheep for a goose . '' `` Then this year we shall really have roast goose to eat , my dear old man . You are always thinking of something to give me pleasure . How charming that is ! We can let the goose walk about with a string to her leg , and she 'll grow fatter still before we roast her . '' `` But I gave away the goose for a fowl , '' said the man . `` A fowl ? That was a good exchange ! '' replied the woman . `` The fowl will lay eggs and hatch them , and we shall have chickens : we shall have a whole poultry-yard ! Oh , that 's just what I was wishing for . '' `` Yes , but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apples . '' `` What ! -- I must positively kiss you for that , '' exclaimed the wife . `` My dear , good husband ! Now , I 'll tell you something . Do you know , you had hardly left me this morning , before I began thinking how I could give you something very nice this evening . I thought it should be pancakes with savoury herbs . I had eggs , and bacon too ; but I wanted herbs . So I went over to the schoolmaster 's -- they have herbs there , I know -- but the schoolmistress is a mean woman , though she looks so sweet . I begged her to lend me a handful of herbs . ` Lend ! ' she answered me ; ` nothing at all grows in our garden , not even a shrivelled apple . I could not even lend you a shrivelled apple , my dear woman . ' But now _ I _ can lend _ her _ ten , or a whole sackful . That I 'm very glad of ; that makes me laugh ! '' And with that she gave him a sounding kiss . `` I like that ! '' exclaimed both the Englishmen together . `` Always going down-hill , and always merry ; that 's worth the money . '' So they paid a hundredweight of gold to the peasant , who was not scolded , but kissed . Yes , it always pays , when the wife sees and always asserts that her husband knows best , and that whatever he does is right . You see , that is my story . I heard it when I was a child ; and now you have heard it too , and know that `` What the old man does is always right . ''
