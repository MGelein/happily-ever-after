THE MONKS OF CATALONIA La Fontain TO you , my friends , allow me to detail , The feats of monks in Catalonia 's vale , Where oft the holy fathers pow ` rs displayed , And showed such charity to wife and maid , That o ` er their minds sweet fascination reigned , And made them think , they Paradise had gained . SUCH characters oft preciously advise , And youthful easy female minds surprise , The beauteous FAIR encircle with their net , And , of the feeling heart , possession get : Work in the holy vineyard , you may guess , And , as our tale will show , with full success . IN times of old , when learning ` mong the FAIR , Enough to read the testament , was rare , -LRB-B- Times howsoe'er thought difficult to quote , -RRB-B- A swarm of monks of gormandizing note , Arrived and fixed themselves within a town , For young and beauteous belles of great renown , While , of gallants , there seemed but very few , Though num ` rous aged husbands you might view . A NOBLE chapel soon the fathers raised , To which the females ran and highly praised , Surveyed it o ` er and confidently thought , 'Twas there , of course , salvation should be sought . And when their faith had thoroughly been proved , To gain their point the monks the veil removed . -- Good father Andrew scorned to use finesse , And in discourse the sex would thus address . IF any thing prevent your sov ` reign bliss , And Paradise incautiously you miss , Most certainly the evil will arise , From keeping for your husbands large supplies , Of what a surplus you have clearly got , And more than requisite to them allot , Without bestowing on your trusty friends , The saving that to no one blessings lends . PERHAPS you 'll tell me , marriage boons we shun ; ` Tis true , and Heav ` n be praised enough is done , Without those duties to require our share You know from direful sin we guard the FAIR . Ingratitude 's declared the height of crimes , And God pronounced it such in early times ; For this eternally was Satan curst ; Howe'er you err , be careful of the worst . Return to Heav ` n your thanks for bounteous care , And then to us a tithe of surplus spare , Which costs you nothing worth a moment 's thought ; And marks the zeal with which our faith is taught , A claim legitimate our order opes , Bestowed , for holy offices , by popes , No charitable gift , but lawful right : PriestsS well supported are a glorious sight . Four times a year , exactly to a day , Each wife this tithe should personally pay Our holy saint requires that you submit : ` Tis founded on decrees of holy writ . All Nature carefully the law reveres , That gratitude and fealty endears . NOW marriage works we rank as an estate , And tithe is due for that at any rate . We 'll take it patiently , whate'er the toil : Nor be o ` er nice about the justful spoil . Our order have not , you must surely know , By many comforts , what we wish below . ` TIS right , however , that I now suggest , Whatever passes must not be expressed ; But naught to husbands , parents , friends , reveal ; From ev ` ry one the mysterious conceal . Three words th ' apostle taught : be these your care ; FAITH , CHARITY , and PRUDENCE learn to share . THE holy father , by his fine discourse , Delivered with the most impressive force , Gave wonderous satisfaction and surprise , And passed with all for Solomon the wise ; Few slept while Andrew preached , and ev ` ry wife , His precepts guarded as she would her life ; And these not solely treasured in the mind , But showed to practice them the heart inclined , Each hastened tithe to bring without delay , And quarrelled who should be the first to pay ; Loud murmurs rang , and many city dames , Were forced to keep till morn the friar 's claims , And HOLY CHURCH , not knowing what to do , Such numbers seemed to be in paying cue , At length was forced , without restraint , to say , The Lord commands that , till a future day , You give us time to breathe : -- so large the lot , To serve for present we enough have got ; Too much the whole at once , but by degrees , Your tithe we 'll take and all contrive to please . With us arrange the hour you would be here , And some to-day : -- to-morrow more we 'll cheer ; The whole in order , and you 'll clearly see , That SOFTLY with FAIRLY best agree . THE sex inclined to follow this advice ; About receipts however they were not nice ; The entertainment greatly was admired , And pure devotion all their bosoms fired , A glass of cordial some apart received ; Good cheer was given , may be well believed ; Ten youthful dames brisk friar Fripart took , Gay , airy , and engaging ev ` ry look , Who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish ; Some had fifteen : -- some twelve to taste their dish ; Good friar Rock had twenty for his share , And gave such satisfaction to the FAIR , That some , to show they never grudged the price , And proved their punctuality , -- paid twice . So much indeed , that satiated with ways , That six long months engaged their nights and days : They gladly credit would have given now , But found the ladies would not this allow , Believing it most positively wrong , To keep whate'er might to the church belong . No tithe arrears were any where around , So zealous were the dames in duty found , They often in advance paid holy dues , How pure the monks ! -- how just the ladies views ! The friars used despatch alone with those , That for their fascinating charms they chose , And sent the sempiternals to bestow , The tribute they had brought on those below , For in the refuse tithes that were their lot , The laicks oft pleasant pickings got . In short 'twas difficult to say , What charity was shown from day to day . IT happened that one night a married dame , Desirous to convey the monks their claim , And walking with her spouse just by the spot , Where dwelled the arch contrivers of the plot , Good HeavensS ! said she , I well remember now , I 've business with a friar here , I vow ; ` Twill presently be done if you 'll but wait ; Religious duties we must ne'er abate . What duties ? cried the husband with surprise ; You 're surely mad : -- ` tis midnight I surmise ; Confess yourself to-morrow if required ; The holy fathers are to bed retired . That makes no difference , the lady cried . -- I think it does , the husband straight replied , And thither I 'll not let you go to-night : -- What heinous sins so terribly affright , That in such haste the mind you wish to ease ? To-morrow morn repair whene'er you please : YOU do me wrong , rejoined the charming fair ; I neither want confession nor a prayer , But anxiously desire what is due to pay ; For if incautiously I should delay , Long time ` would be ere I the monk should see , With other matters he 'll so busy be . But what can you the holy fathers owe ? To which the lady said : -- what do n't you know ? A tithe , my dear , the friars always claim . -- What tithe ? cried he ; it surely has a name . Not know ! astonishingly , replied the wife . -- To which the husband answered : -- On my life , That women friars pay is very strange ; Will you particulars with me arrange ? How cunningly , said she , you seem to act ; Why clearly you 're acquainted with the fact ? ` Tis Hymeneal works : -- What works ? cried he -- Lord ! said the dame , assuredly you see , Why I had paid an hour ago or more And you 've prevented me when at the door ; I 'm sure , of those who owe , I 'm not the worst , For I , in paying , always was the first . THE husband quite astonished now appeared ; At once a hundred diff ` rent ills he feared ; But questioning his wife howe'er , he found , That many other dames who lived around , Like her ; in paying tithes , the monks obeyed , Which consolation to his breast conveyed . Poor innocent ! she nothing wished to hide ; Said she , not one but tithe they make provide ; Good friar Aubrey takes your sister 's dues ; To father Fabry Mrs. B 's accrues ; The mayoress friar William likes to greet , A monk more handsome scarcely you will meet ; And I to friar Gerard always go ; I wished this night to pay him all I owe . ALAS ! when tongues unbridled drop disguise , What direful ills , what discords oft arise ! The cunning husband having thus obtained , ParticularsS of what the fathers gained , At first designed in secret to disclose , Those scenes of fraud and matrimonial woes : The mayor and citizens should know , he thought ; What dues were paid : what tithes the friars sought ; But since 'twas rather difficult to place , Full credence , at the first , in such a case , He judged it best to make the fellow speak , To whom his wife had shown herself so weak . FOR father Gerard in the morn he sent , Who , unsuspecting , to the husband went , When , in the presence of the injured wife , He drew his sword and swore he 'd take his life , Unless the mystery he would disclose , Which he reluctantly through terror chose . Then having bound the friar hand and foot , And in another room his lady put , He sallied forth his hapless lot to tell , And to the mayor exposed the wily spell ; The corporation next ; then up and down , The secret he divulged throughout the town . A CRY for vengeance presently was heard ; The whole at once to slaughter , some preferred While others would the place with fire surround , And burn the house with those within it found . Some wished to drown them , bound within their dress ; With various other projects you may guess ; But all agreed that death should be their lot , And those for burning had most voices got . WITHOUT delay they to the convent flew ; But when the holy mansion came in view , Respect , the place of execution changed ; A citizen his barn for this arranged ; The crafty crew together were confined , And in the blaze their wretched lives resigned , While round the husbands danced at sound of drum , And burnt whatever to their hands had come ; Naught ` scaped their fury , monks of all degrees , Robes , mantles , capuchins , and mock decrees : All perished properly within the flames ; But nothing more I find about the dames ; And friar Gerard , in another place , Had met apart his merited disgrace .
