THE BEETLE . H. C. Andersen The emperor 's favorite horse was shod with gold . It had a golden shoe on each of its feet . And why was this ? He was a beautiful creature , with delicate legs , bright intelligent eyes , and a mane that hung down over his neck like a veil . He had carried his master through the fire and smoke of battle , and heard the bullets whistling around him , had kicked , bitten , and taken part in the fight when the enemy advanced , and had sprung with his master on his back over the fallen foe , and had saved the crown of red gold , and the life of the emperor , which was more valuable than the red gold ; and that is why the emperor 's horse had golden shoes . And a beetle came creeping forth . `` First the great ones , '' said he , `` and then the little ones ; but greatness is not the only thing that does it . '' And so saying , he stretched out his thin legs . `` And pray what do you want ? '' asked the smith . `` Golden shoes , to be sure , '' replied the beetle . `` Why , you must be out of your senses , '' cried the smith . `` Do you want to have golden shoes too ? '' `` Golden shoes ? certainly , '' replied the beetle . `` Am I not just as good as that big creature yonder , that is waited on , and brushed , and has meat and drink put before him ? Do n't I belong to the imperial stable ? '' `` But _ why _ is the horse to have golden shoes ? Do n't you understand that ? '' asked the smith . `` Understand ? I understand that it is a personal slight offered to myself , '' cried the beetle . `` It is done to annoy me , and therefore I am going into the world to seek my fortune . '' `` Go along ! '' said the smith . `` You 're a rude fellow ! '' cried the beetle ; and then he went out of the stable , flew a little way , and soon afterwards found himself in a beautiful flower garden , all fragrant with roses and lavender . `` Is it not beautiful here ? '' asked one of the little lady-birds that flew about , with their delicate wings and their red-and-black shields on their backs . `` How sweet it is here -- how beautiful it is ! '' `` I 'm accustomed to better things , '' said the beetle . `` Do you call _ this _ beautiful ? Why , there is not so much as a dung-heap . '' Then he went on , under the shadow of a great stack , and found a caterpillar crawling along . `` How beautiful the world is ! '' said the caterpillar : `` the sun is so warm , and everything so enjoyable ! And when I go to sleep , and die , as they call it , I shall wake up as a butterfly , with beautiful wings to fly with . '' `` How conceited you are ! '' exclaimed the stag-beetle . `` Fly about as a butterfly , indeed ! I 've come out of the stable of the emperor , and no one there , not even the emperor 's favorite horse -- that by the way wears my cast-off golden shoes -- has any such idea . To have wings to fly ! why , we can fly now ; '' and he spread his wings and flew away . `` I do n't want to be annoyed , and yet I am annoyed , '' he said , as he flew off . Soon afterwards he fell down upon a great lawn . For awhile he lay there and feigned slumber ; at last he fell asleep in earnest . Suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds . The beetle woke up at the noise , and wanted to escape into the earth , but could not . He was tumbled over and over ; sometimes he was swimming on his stomach , sometimes on his back , and as for flying , that was out of the question ; he doubted whether he should escape from the place with his life . He therefore remained lying where he was . When the weather had moderated a little , and the beetle had rubbed the water out of his eyes , he saw something gleaming . It was linen that had been placed there to bleach . He managed to make his way up to it , and crept into a fold of the damp linen . Certainly the place was not so comfortable to lie in as the warm stable ; but there was no better to be had , and therefore he remained lying there for a whole day and a whole night , and the rain kept on during all the time . Towards morning he crept forth : he was very much out of temper about the climate . On the linen two frogs were sitting . Their bright eyes absolutely gleamed with pleasure . `` Wonderful weather this ! '' one of them cried . `` How refreshing ! And the linen keeps the water together so beautifully . My hind legs seem to quiver as if I were going to swim . '' `` I should like to know , '' said the second , `` if the swallow , who flies so far round , in her many journeys in foreign lands ever meets with a better climate than this . What delicious dampness ! It is really as if one were lying in a wet ditch . Whoever does not rejoice in this , certainly does not love his fatherland . '' `` Have you been in the emperor 's stable ? '' asked the beetle : `` there the dampness is warm and refreshing . That 's the climate for me ; but I can not take it with me on my journey . Is there never a muck-heap , here in the garden , where a person of rank , like myself , can feel himself at home , and take up his quarters ? '' But the frogs either did not or would not understand him . `` I never ask a question twice ! '' said the beetle , after he had already asked this one three times without receiving any answer . Then he went a little farther , and stumbled against a fragment of pottery , that certainly ought not to have been lying there ; but as it was once there , it gave a good shelter against wind and weather . Here dwelt several families of earwigs ; and these did not require much , only sociality . The female members of the community were full of the purest maternal affection , and accordingly each one considered her own child the most beautiful and cleverest of all . `` Our son has engaged himself , '' said one mother . `` Dear , innocent boy ! His greatest hope is that he may creep one day into a clergyman 's ear . It 's very artless and loveable , that ; and being engaged will keep him steady . What joy for a mother ! '' `` Our son , '' said another mother , `` had scarcely crept out of the egg , when he was already off on his travels . He 's all life and spirits ; he 'll run his horns off ! What joy that is for a mother ! Is it not so , Mr. Beetle ? '' for she knew the stranger by his horny coat . `` You are both quite right , '' said he ; so they begged him to walk in ; that is to say , to come as far as he could under the bit of pottery . `` Now , you also see _ my _ little earwig , '' observed a third mother and a fourth ; `` they are lovely little things , and highly amusing . They are never ill-behaved , except when they are uncomfortable in their inside ; but , unfortunately , one is very subject to that at their age . '' Thus each mother spoke of her baby ; and the babies talked among themselves , and made use of the little nippers they have in their tails to nip the beard of the beetle . `` Yes , they are always busy about something , the little rogues ! '' said the mothers ; and they quite beamed with maternal pride ; but the beetle felt bored by that , and therefore he inquired how far it was to the nearest muck-heap . `` That is quite out in the big world , on the other side of the ditch , '' answered an earwig . `` I hope none of my children will go so far , for it would be the death of me . '' `` But I shall try to get so far , '' said the beetle ; and he went off without taking formal leave ; for that is considered the polite thing to do . And by the ditch he met several friends ; beetles , all of them . `` Here we live , '' they said . `` We are very comfortable here . Might we ask you to step down into this rich mud ? You must be fatigued after your journey . '' `` Certainly , '' replied the beetle . `` I have been exposed to the rain , and have had to lie upon linen , and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me . I have also pains in one of my wings , from standing in a draught under a fragment of pottery . It is really quite refreshing to be among one 's companions once more . '' `` Perhaps you come from some muck-heap ? '' observed the oldest of them . `` Indeed , I come from a much higher place , '' replied the beetle . `` I came from the emperor 's stable , where I was born with golden shoes on my feet . I am traveling on a secret embassy . You must not ask me any questions , for I ca n't betray my secret . '' With this the beetle stepped down into the rich mud . There sat three young maiden beetles ; and they tittered , because they did not know what to say . `` Not one of them is engaged yet , '' said their mother ; and the beetle maidens tittered again , this time from embarrassment . `` I have never seen greater beauties in the royal stables , '' exclaimed the beetle , who was now resting himself . `` Do n't spoil my girls , '' said the mother ; `` and do n't talk to them , please , unless you have serious intentions . But of course your intentions are serious , and therefore I give you my blessing . '' `` Hurrah ! '' cried all the other beetles together ; and our friend was engaged . Immediately after the betrothal came the marriage , for there was no reason for delay . The following day passed very pleasantly , and the next in tolerable comfort ; but on the third it was time to think of food for the wife , and perhaps also for children . `` I have allowed myself to be taken in , '' said our beetle to himself . `` And now there 's nothing for it but to take _ them _ in , in turn . '' So said , so done . Away he went , and he stayed away all day , and stayed away all night ; and his wife sat there , a forsaken widow . `` Oh , '' said the other beetles , `` this fellow whom we received into our family is nothing more than a thorough vagabond . He has gone away , and has left his wife a burden upon our hands . '' -LRB-B- Illustration : THE SCHOLARS FIND THE BEETLE . aaaaa -RRB-B- aaa `` Well , then , she shall be unmarried again , and sit here among my daughters , '' said the mother . `` Fie on the villain who forsook her ! '' In the meantime the beetle had been journeying on , and had sailed across the ditch on a cabbage leaf . In the morning two persons came to the ditch . When they saw him , they took him up , and turned him over and over , and looked very learned , especially one of them -- a boy . `` Allah sees the black beetle in the black stone and in the black rock . Is not that written in the Koran ? '' Then he translated the beetle 's name into Latin , and enlarged upon the creature 's nature and history . The second person , an older scholar , voted for carrying him home . He said they wanted just such good specimens ; and this seemed an uncivil speech to our beetle , and in consequence he flew suddenly out of the speaker 's hand . As he had now dry wings , he flew a tolerable distance , and reached a hot-bed , where a sash of the glass roof was partly open , so he quietly slipped in and buried himself in the warm earth . `` Very comfortable it is here , '' said he . Soon after he went to sleep , and dreamed that the emperor 's favorite horse had fallen , and had given him his golden shoes , with the promise that he should have two more . That was all very charming . When the beetle woke up , he crept forth and looked around him . What splendor was in the hothouse ! In the background great palm trees growing up on high ; the sun made them look transparent ; and beneath them what a luxuriance of green , and of beaming flowers , red as fire , yellow as amber , or white as fresh-fallen snow . `` This is an incomparable plenty of plants , '' cried the beetle . `` How good they will taste when they are decayed ! A capital store-room this ! There must certainly be relations of mine living here . I will just see if I can find any one with whom I may associate . I 'm proud , certainly , and I 'm proud of being so . '' And so he prowled about in the earth , and thought what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse , and the golden shoes he had inherited . Suddenly a hand seized the beetle , and pressed him , and turned him round and round . The gardener 's little son and a companion had come to the hot-bed , had espied the beetle , and wanted to have their fun with him . First he was wrapped in a vine leaf , and then put into warm trousers-pocket . He cribbled and crabbled about there with all his might ; but he got a good pressing from the boy 's hand for this , which served as a hint to him to keep quiet . Then the boy went rapidly towards the great lake that lay at the end of the garden . Here the beetle was put in an old broken wooden shoe , on which a little stick was placed upright for a mast , and to this mast the beetle was bound with a woollen thread . Now he was a sailor , and had to sail away . The lake was not very large , but to the beetle it seemed an ocean ; and he was so astonished at its extent , that he fell over on his back and kicked out with his legs . The little ship sailed away . The current of the water seized it ; but whenever it went too far from the shore , one of the boys turned up his trousers and went in after it , and brought it back to the land . But at length , just as it went merrily out again , the two boys were called away , and very harshly , so that they hurried to obey the summons , ran away from the lake , and left the little ship to its fate . Thus it drove away from the shore , farther and farther into the open sea : it was terrible work for the beetle , for he could not get away in consequence of being bound to the mast . Then a fly came and paid him a visit . `` What beautiful weather ! '' said the fly . `` I 'll rest here , and sun myself . You have an agreeable time of it . '' `` You speak without knowing the facts , '' replied the beetle . `` Do n't you see that I 'm a prisoner ? '' `` Ah ! but I 'm not a prisoner , '' observed the fly ; and he flew away accordingly . `` Well , now I know the world , '' said the beetle to himself . `` It is an abominable world . I 'm the only honest person in it . First , they refuse me my golden shoes ; then I have to lie on wet linen , and to stand in the draught ; and , to crown all , they fasten a wife upon me . Then , when I 've taken a quick step out into the world , and found out how one can have it there , and how I wished to have it , one of those human boys comes and ties me up , and leaves me to the mercy of the wild waves , while the emperor 's favorite horse prances about proudly in golden shoes . That is what annoys me more than all . But one must not look for sympathy in this world ! My career has been very interesting ; but what 's the use of that , if nobody knows it ? The world does not deserve to be made acquainted with my history , for it ought to have given me golden shoes , when the emperor 's horse was shod , and I stretched out my feet to be shod too . If I had received golden shoes , I should have become an ornament to the stable . Now the stable has lost me , and the world has lost me . It is all over ! '' But all was not over yet . A boat , in which there were a few young girls , came rowing up . `` Look , yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along , '' said one of the girls . `` There 's a little creature bound fast to it , '' said another . The boat came quite close to our beetle 's ship , and the young girls fished him out of the water . One of them drew a small pair of scissors from her pocket , and cut the woollen thread , without hurting the beetle ; and when she stepped on shore , she put him down on the grass . `` Creep , creep -- fly , fly -- if thou canst , '' she said . `` Liberty is a splendid thing . '' And the beetle flew up , and straight through the open window of a great building ; there he sank down , tired and exhausted , exactly on the mane of the emperor 's favorite horse , who stood in the stable when he was at home , and the beetle also . The beetle clung fast to the mane , and sat there a short time to recover himself . `` Here I 'm sitting on the emperor 's favorite horse -- sitting on him just like the emperor himself ! '' he cried . `` But what was I saying ? Yes , now I remember . That 's a good thought , and quite correct . The smith asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse . Now I 'm quite clear about the answer . They were given to the horse on _ my _ account . '' And now the beetle was in a good temper again . `` Travelling expands the mind rarely , '' said he . The sun 's rays came streaming into the stable , and shone upon him , and made the place lively and bright . `` The world is not so bad , upon the whole , '' said the beetle ; `` but one must know how to take things as they come .
