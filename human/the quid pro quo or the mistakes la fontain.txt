THE QUID PRO QUO OR THE MISTAKES La Fontain DAME FORTUNE often loves a laugh to raise , And , playing off her tricks and roguish ways , Instead of giving us what we desire , Mere quid pro quo permits us to acquire . I 've found her gambols such from first to last , And judge the future by experience past . Fair Cloris and myself felt mutual flame ; And , when a year had run , the sprightly dame Prepared to grant me , if I may be plain , Some slight concessions that would ease my pain . This was her aim ; but whatsoe'er in view , ` Tis opportunity we should pursue ; The lover , who 's discreet , will moments seize ; And ev ` ry effort then will tend to please . ONE eve I went this charming fair to see ; The husband happened -LRB-B- luckily for me -RRB-B- To be abroad ; but just as it was night The master came , not doubting all was right ; No Cloris howsoe'er was in the way ; A servant girl , of disposition gay , Well known to me , with pretty smiling face , ` Tis said , was led to take her lady 's place . The mistress ' loss for once was thus repaid ; The barter mutual : -- wife against the maid . WITH many tales like this the books abound ; But able hands are necessary found , To place the incidents , arrange the whole , That nothing may be forced nor feel control . The urchin blind , who sees enough to lay His num ` rous snares , such tricks will often play . The CRADLE in Boccace excels the most , As to myself I do not mean to boast , But fear , a thousand places , spite of toil , By him made excellent , my labors spoil . ` Tis time howe'er with preface to have done , And show , by some new turn , or piece of fun , -LRB-B- While easy numbers from my pencil flow , -RRB-B- Of Fortune and of Love the quid pro quo . In proof , we 'll state what happened at MarseillesS : The story is so true , no doubt prevails . THERE Clidamant , whose proper name my verse , Prom high respect , refuses to rehearse , Lived much at ease : not one a wife had got , Throughout the realm , who was so nice a lot , Her virtues , temper , and seraphick charms , Should have secured the husband to her arms ; But he was not to constancy inclined ; The devil 's crafty ; snares has often twined Around and round , with ev ` ry subtle art , When love of novelty he would impart . THE lady had a maid , whose form and size , Height , easy manners , action , lips , and eyes , Were thought to be so very like her own , That one from t ` other scarcely could be known ; The mistress was the prettiest of the two ; But , in a mask where much escapes the view , 'Twas very difficult a choice to make , And feel no doubts which better ` twere to take . THE Marseillesian husband , rather gay , With mistress Alice was disposed to play ; -LRB-B- For such was called the maid we just have named ; -RRB-B- To show coquettish airs the latter aimed , And met his wishes with reproof severe ; But to his plan the lover would adhere , And promised her at length a pretty sum : A hundred crowns , if to his room she 'd come . To pay the girl with kindness such as this , In my opinion , was not much amiss . At that rate what should be the mistress ' price ? Perhaps still less : she might not be so nice . But I mistake ; the lady was so coy , No spark , whatever art he could employ , How cleverly soe'er he laid the snare , Would have succeeded , spite of ev ` ry care . Nor presents nor attentions would have swayed ; Should I have mentioned presents as an aid ? Alas ! no longer these are days of old ! By Love both nymph and shepherdess are sold ; He sets the price of many beauties rare ; This was a god ; -- now nothing but a mayor . O ALTERED times ! O customs how depraved ! At first fair Alice frowardly behaved ; But in the sequel ` gan to change her way , And said , her mistress , as the foll ` wing day , A certain remedy to take designed ; That , in the morning then , if so inclined , They could at leisure in the cavern meet ; -- The plan was pleasing : all appeared discreet . THE servant , having to her mistress said , What projects were in view : what nets were spread ; The females , ` tween themselves , a plot contrived , Of Quid pro quo , against the hour arrived . The husband of the trick was ne'er aware , So much the mistress had her servant 's air ; But if he had , what then ? no harm of course ; She might have lectured him with double force . NEXT day but one , gay Clidamant , whose joy Appeared so great , 'twas free from all alloy , By hazard met a friend , to whom he told -LRB-B- Most indiscreetly -RRB-B- what to him was sold ; How Cupid favored what he most required , And freely granted all he had desired . Though large the blessing , yet he grudged the cost ; The sum gave pain : a hundred crowns were lost ! The friend proposed they should at once decide , The charge and pleasure ` tween them to divide . Our husband thought his purse not over strong , That saving fifty crowns would not be wrong . But then , on t ` other hand , to lend the fair , In ev ` ry view had got an awkward air ; Would she , as was proposed , consent to two ? To keep things secret would their lips be true ? Or was it fair to sacrifice her charms , And lay her open thus to dire alarms ? THE friend this difficulty soon removed , And represented that the cavern proved So very dark , the girl would be deceived ; With one more shrewd the trick might be achieved . Sufficient howsoever it would be , If they by turns , and silent , could agree To meet the belle , and leave to Love the rest , From whom they hoped assistance if distressed . Such silence to observe no hurt could do , And Alice would suppose , a prudent view Retained the tongue , since walls have often ears , And , being mum , expressive was of fears . WHEN thus the two gallants their plan had laid , And ev ` ry promised pleasure fully weighed , They to the husband 's mansion made their way , Where yet the wife between the bed-clothes lay . The servant girl was near her mistress found ; Her dress was plain : no finery around ; In short , 'twas such that , when the moment came ; To fail the meeting could not be her aim . THE friends disputed which the lead should take , And strong pretentions both appeared to make ; The husband , honors home would not allow : Such compliments were out of fashion now . To settle this , at length three dice they took ; The friend was highest placed in Fortune 's book . The both together to the cavern flew , And for the servant soon impatient grew ; But Alice never came , and in her room The mistress , softly treading ` mid the gloom , The necessary signal gently gave , On which she entered presently the cave , And this so suddenly , no time was found To make remarks on change or errors round , Or any diff ` rence ` tween the friend and spouse ; In short , before suspicions ` gan to rouse , Or alteration lent the senses aid : -- To LOVE , a sacrifice was fully made . The lucky wight more pleasure would have felt , If sensible he 'd been with whom he dealt : The mistress rather more of beauty had , And QUALITY of course must something add . THIS scene just ended , t ` other actor came , Whose prompt
