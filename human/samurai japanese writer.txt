SAMURAI ! '' Japanese Writer Thus Kintaro 's fate was settled , and the general decided to start for the Capital at once , taking Kintaro with him . It need hardly be said that Yama-uba was sad at parting with her boy , for he was all that was left to her . But she hid her grief with a strong face , as they say in Japan . She knew that it was for her boy 's good that he should leave her now , and she must not discourage him just as he was setting out . Kintaro promised never to forget her , and said that as soon as he was a knight wearing two swords he would build her a home and take care of her in her old age . All the animals , those he had tamed to serve him , the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare , as soon as they found out that he was going away , came to ask if they might attend him as usual . When they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off . `` Kimbo , '' said his mother , `` mind and be a good boy . '' `` Mr. Kintaro , '' said the faithful animals , `` we wish you good health on your travels . '' Then they all climbed a tree to see the last of him , and from that height they watched him and his shadow gradually grow smaller and smaller , till he was lost to sight . The general Sadamitsu went on his way rejoicing at having so unexpectedly found such a prodigy as Kintaro . Having arrived at their destination the general took Kintaro at once to his Lord , Minamoto-no-Raiko , and told him all about Kintaro and how he had found the child . Lord Raiko was delighted with the story , and having commanded Kintaro to be brought to him , made him one of his vassals at once . Lord Raiko 's army was famous for its band called `` The Four BravesS . '' These warriors were chosen by himself from amongst the bravest and strongest of his soldiers , and the small and well-picked band was distinguished throughout the whole of Japan for the dauntless courage of its men . When Kintaro grew up to be a man his master made him the Chief of the Four BravesS . He was by far the strongest of them all . Soon after this event , news was brought to the city that a cannibal monster had taken up his abode not far away and that people were stricken with fear . Lord Raiko ordered Kintaro to the rescue . He immediately started off , delighted at the prospect of trying his sword . Surprising the monster in its den , he made short work of cutting off its great head , which he carried back in triumph to his master . Kintaro now rose to be the greatest hero of his country , and great was the power and honor and wealth that came to him . He now kept his promise and built a comfortable home for his old mother , who lived happily with him in the Capital to the end of her days . Is not this the story of a great hero ?
