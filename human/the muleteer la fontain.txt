THE MULETEER La Fontain THE Lombard princes oft pervade my mind ; The present tale Boccace relates you 'll find ; Agiluf was the noble monarch 's name ; Teudelingua he married , beauteous dame , The last king 's widow , who had left no heir , And whose dominions proved our prince 's share . No Beauty round compare could with the queen ; And ev ` ry blessing on the throne was seen , When Cupid , in a playful moment , came , And o ` er Agiluf 's stable placed his flame ; There left it carelessly to burn at will , Which soon began a muleteer to fill , With LOVE 'S all-powerful , all-consuming fire , That naught controls , and youthful breasts desire . THE muleteer was pleasing to the sight : Gallant , good-humoured , airy , and polite , And ev ` ry way his humble birth belied ; A handsome person , nor was sense denied ; He showed it well , for when the youth beheld , With eyes of love , the queen , who all excelled , And ev ` ry effort anxiously had made , To stop the flames that would his heart invade ; When vain it proved , he took a prudent part : -- WHO can , like Cupid , manage wily art ? Whate'er stupidity we may discern , His pupils more within a day can learn , Than MASTERS knowledge in the schools can gain , Though they in study should ten years remain ; The lowest clown he presently inspires , With ev ` ry tendency that love requires ; Of this our present tale 's a proof direct , And none that feel -- its truths will e ` er suspect : THE am ` rous muleteer his thoughts employed ; Consid ` ring how his wish might be enjoyed . Without success to certainty were brought , Life seemed to him not worth a slender thought ; To hazard ev ` ry thing ; to live or die ! Possession have ! -- or in the grave to lie ! THE Lombard custom was , that when the king , Who slept not with his queen , -LRB-B- a common thing In other countries too -RRB-B- , desired to greet His royal consort , and in bed to meet , A night-gown solely o ` er his back he threw , And then proceeded to the interview , Knocked softly at the door , on which a fair , Who waited on the queen with anxious care , Allowed the prince to enter ; took his light , -LRB-B- Which only glimmered in the midst of night , -RRB-B- Then put it out , and quickly left the room : -- A little lantern to dispel the gloom , With waxen taper that emitted rays -- In diff ` rent countries various are their ways ! OUR wily , prying , crafty muleteer , Knew well these forms were current through the year : He , like the king , at night himself equipped , And to the queen 's superb apartment slipped . His face concealed the fellow tried to keep ; The waiting dame was more than half asleep ; The lover got access : -- soon all was clear ; The prince 's coming he had but to fear , And , as the latter had , throughout the day , The chase attended an extensive way , 'Twas more than probable he 'd not be led , -LRB-B- Since such fatigue he 'd had , -RRB-B- to quit his bed . PERFUMED , quite neat , and lively as a bird , Our spark -LRB-B- safe entered -RRB-B- uttered not a word . 'Twas often customary with the king , When state affairs , or other weighty thing , Displeasure gave , to take of love his fill , Yet let his tongue the while continue still . A singularity we needs must own , With this the wife was long familiar grown . OUR am ` rous wight more joys than one received , If our narrator of the tale 's believed ; -LRB-B- In bed a muleteer is worth three kings , And value oft is found in humble things . -RRB-B- The queen began to think her husband 's rage Had proved a stimulus such wars to wage , And made him wond ` rous stout in pleasure 's sport , Though all the while his thoughts were - ` bout the court . WITH perfect justice Heav ` n its gifts bestows ; But equal talents all should not compose . The prince 's virtues doubtless were designed , To take command , and govern o ` er mankind . The lawyer , points of difficulty views , Decides with judgment , and the truth pursues . In Cupid 's scenes the muleteer succeeds : -- Each has his part : -- none universal meeds . WITH pleasures feasted , our gallant retired , Before the morn fresh blushes had acquired . But scarcely had he left the tender scene , ` Ere king Agiluf came to see his queen , Who much surprise expressed , and to him said : My dear , I know your love , but from this bed , You 'll recollect how recently you went , And having wonders done , should be content . For heav 'n' s sake , consider more your health ; ` Tis dearer far to me than Croesus ' wealth . WITHIN the royal breast suspicions rose , But nothing then the monarch would disclose . He instantly withdrew without a word ; His sentiments to speak had been absurd , And to the stable flew , since he believed The circumstances , which his bosom grieved , Whate'er mysterious doubts might then appear , Proceeded from some am ` rous muleteer . WHEN round the dorture he began to creep , The troop appeared as if dissolved in sleep , And so they truly were , save our gallant , Whose terrors made him tremble , sigh , and pant : No light the king had got ; it still was dark ; Agiluf groped about to find the spark , Persuaded that the culprit might be known , By rapid beating of the pulse alone . The thought was good ; to feel the prince began , And at the second venture , found his man , Who , whether from the pleasures he 'd enjoyed , Or fear , or dread discov ` ry to avoid , Experienced -LRB-B- spite of ev ` ry wily art , -RRB-B- At once quick beating of the pulse and heart . In doubt how this adventure yet might end , He thought to seem asleep would him befriend . MEANWHILE the king , though not without much pains , Obtained the scissors used for horses ' manes . With these , he said , I 'll mark the fond gallant , That I may know again the one I want . THE monarch from the muleteer with care , In front , snipt off a bulky lock of hair . This having done , he suddenly withdrew ; But carelessly away the trophy threw ; Of which the sly gallant advantage took , And thus the prince 's subtle project shook ; For instantly began our artful spark , His fellow servants like himself to mark . WHEN day arrived the monarch was surprised , To see each muleteer alike disguised ; No hair in front of either now was seen ; Why , how is this ? said he : What can it mean ? Fifteen or more , if I believe my sight , My wife has satisfied this very night . Well ! well ! he 'll now escape if mum he prove ; But there again I trust he ne'er shall move .
