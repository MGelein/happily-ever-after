THE GLUTTON La Fontain A STURGEON , once , a glutton famed was led To have for supper -- all , except the head . With wond ` rous glee he feasted on the fish ; And quickly swallowed down the royal dish . O'ercharged , howe'er , his stomach soon gave way ; And doctors were required without delay . THE danger imminent , his friends desired He 'd settle ev ` ry thing affairs required . Said he , in that respect I 'm quite prepared ; And , since my time so little is declared , With diligence , I earnestly request , The sturgeon 's head you 'll get me nicely dressed .
