THE GASCON La Fontain I AM always inclined to suspect The best story under the sun As soon as by chance I detect That teller and hero are one . We 're all of us prone to conceit , And like to proclaim our own glory , But our purpose we 're apt to defeat As actors in chief of our story . To prove the truth of what I state Let me an anecdote relate : A Gascon with his comrade sat At tavern drinking . This and that He vaunted with assertion pat . From gasconade to gasconade Passed to the conquests he had made In love . A buxom country maid , Who served the wine , with due attention Lent patient ear to each invention , And pressed her hands against her side Her bursting merriment to hide . To hear our Gascon talk , no Sue Nor Poll in town but that he knew ; With each he 'd passed a blissful night More to their own than his delight . This one he loved for she was fair , That for her glossy ebon hair . One miss , to tame his cruel rigor , Had brought him gifts . -- She owned his vigor In short it wanted but his gaze To set each trembling heart ablaze . His strength surpassed his luck , -- the test -- In one short night ten times he 'd blessed A dame who gratefully expressed Her thanks with corresponding zest . At this the maid burst forth , `` What more ? `` I never heard such lies before ! `` Content were I if at that sport `` I had what that poor dame was short . ''
