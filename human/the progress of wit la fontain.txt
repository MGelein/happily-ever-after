THE PROGRESS OF WIT La Fontain DIVERTING in extreme there is a play , Which oft resumes its fascinating sway ; Delights the sex , or ugly , fair , or sour ; By night or day : -- ` tis sweet at any hour . The frolick , ev ` ry where is known to fame ; Conjecture if you can , and tells its name . THIS play 's chief charm to husbands is unknown ; ` Tis with the lover it excels alone ; No lookers-on , as umpires , are required ; No quarrels rise , though each appears inspired ; All seem delighted with the pleasing game : -- Conjecture if you can , and tell its name . BE this as ` twill , and called whate'er it may ; No longer trifling with it I shall stay , But now disclose a method to transmit -LRB-B- As oft we find -RRB-B- to ninnies sense and wit . Till Alice got instruction in this school , She was regarded as a silly fool , Her exercise appeared to spin and sew : -- Not hers indeed , the hands alone would go ; For sense or wit had in it no concern ; Whate'er the foolish girl had got to learn , No part therein could ever take the mind ; Her doll , for thought , was just as well designed . The mother would , a hundred times a day , Abuse the stupid maid , and to her say Go wretched lump and try some wit to gain . THE girl , quite overcome with shame and pain ; Her neighbors asked to point her out the spot , Where useful wit by purchase might be got . The simple question laughter raised around ; At length they told her , that it might be found With father Bonadventure , who 'd a stock , Which he at times disposed of to his flock . AWAY in haste she to the cloister went , To see the friar she was quite intent , Though trembling lest she might disturb his ease ; And one of his high character displease . The girl exclaimed , as on she moved , -- Will he Such presents willingly bestow on me , Whose age , as yet , has scarcely reached fifteen ? With such can I be worthy to be seen ? Her innocence much added to her charms , The gentle wily god of soft alarms Had not a youthful maiden in his book , That carried more temptation in her look . MOST rev ` rend sir , said she , by friends I 'm told , That in this convent wit is often sold , Will you allow me some on trust to take ? My treasure wo n't afford that much I stake ; I can return if more I should require ; Howe'er , you 'll take this pledge I much desire ; On which she tried to give the monk a ring , That to her finger firmly seemed to cling . BUT when the friar saw the girl 's design , He cried , good maid , the pledge we will decline , And what is wished , provide for you the same ; ` Tis merchandize , and whatsoe'er its fame , To some ` tis freely giv ` n : -- to others taught If not too dear , oft better when ` tis bought . Come in and boldly follow where I lead ; None round can see : you 've nothing here to heed ; They 're all at prayers ; the porter 's at my will ; The very walls , of prudence have their fill . SHE entered as the holy monk desired , And they together to his cell retired . The friar on the bed this maiden threw ; A kiss would take : -- she from him rather drew ; And said . -- To give one wit is this the way ? Yes , answered he , and round her ` gan to play : Upon her bosom then he put his hand What now , said she , am I to understand ? Is this the way ? -- Said he , ` tis so decreed ; Then patiently she let the monk proceed , Who followed up , from point to point , his aim ; And wit , by easy steps , advancing came , Till its progression with her was complete ; Then Alice laughed , success appeared so sweet . A SECOND dose the friar soon bestowed , And e ` en a third , so fast his bounty flowed . Well , said the monk , pray how d'ye find the play ? The girl replied : wit will not long delay ; ` Twill soon arrive ; but then I fear its flight : I 'm half afraid ` twill leave me ere ` tis night . We 'll see , rejoined the priest , that naught you lose ; But other secrets oftentimes we use . Seek not those the smiling girl replied With this most perfectly I 'm satisfied ; Then be it so , said he , we 'll recommence , Nor longer keep the business in suspense , But to the utmost length at once advance ; For this fair Alice showed much complaisance : The secret by the friar was renewed ; Much pleasure in it Bonadventure viewed ; The belle a courtesy dropt , and then retired , Reflecting on the wit she had acquired ; Reflecting , do you say ? -- To think inclined ? Yes , even more : -- she sought excuse to find , Not doubting that she should be forced to say , Some cause for keeping her so long away . TWO days had passed , when came a youthful friend ; Fair Nancy with her often would unbend ; Howe'er , so very thoughtful Alice seemed , That Nancy -LRB-B- who was penetrating deemed -RRB-B- Was well convinced whatever Alice sought , So very absent she was not for naught . In questioning she managed with such art , That soon she learned -- what Alice could impart To listen she was thoroughly disposed , While t ` other ev ` ry circumstance disclosed , From first to last , each point and mystick hit , And e ` en the largeness of the friar 's wit , The repetitions , and the wondrous skill With which he managed ev ` ry thing at will . BUT now , cried Alice , favor me I pray , And tell at once , without reserve , the way That you obtained such wit as you possess , And all particulars to me confess . IF I , said Nancy , must avow the truth , Your brother Alan was the bounteous youth , Who me obliged therewith , and freely taught , What from the holy friar you 'd have bought . My brother Alan ! -- Alan ! Alice cried ; He ne'er with any was himself supplied ; I 'm all surprise ; he 's thought a heavy clot , How could he give what he had never got ? FOOL ! said the other , little thou can ` st know ; For once , to me some information owe ; In such a case much skill is not required , And Alan freely gave what I desired . If me thou disbeliev ` st , thy mother ask ; She thoroughly can undertake the task . ON such a point we readily should say , Long live the fools who wit so well display !
