THE COBBLER La Fontain WE 'RE told , that once a cobbler , BLASE by name ; A wife had got , whose charms so high in fame ; But as it happened , that their cash was spent , The honest couple to a neighbor went , A corn-factor by trade , not overwise To whom they stated facts without disguise ; And begged , with falt ` ring voice denoting care , That he , of wheat , would half a measure spare , Upon their note , which readily he gave , And all advantages desired to wave . THE time for payment came ; the money used ; The cash our factor would not be refused ; Of writs he talked , attorneys , and distress ; The reason : -- heav ` n can tell , and you may guess ; In short , 'twas clear our gay gallant desired , To cheer the wife , whose beauty all admired . SAID he , what anxiously I wish to get , You 've plenty stored , and never wanted yet ; You surely know my meaning ? -- Yes , she cried ; I 'll turn it in my mind , and we 'll decide How best to act . Away she quickly flew , And Blase informed , what Ninny had in view . Zounds ! said the cobbler , we must see , my dear , To hook this little sum : -- the way is clear ; No risk I 'm confident ; for prithee run And tell him I 've a journey just begun ; That he may hither come and have his will ; But ` ere he touch thy lips , demand the bill ; He 'll not refuse the boon I 'm very sure ; Meantime , myself I 'll hide and all secure . The note obtained , cough loudly , strong , and clear ; Twice let it be , that I may plainly hear ; Then forth I 'll sally from my lurking place , And , spite of folly 's frowns , prevent disgrace . THE plot succeeded as the pair desired ; The cobbler laughed , and ALL his scheme admired : A purse-proud cit thereon observed and swore ; ` Twere better to have coughed when all was o ` er ; Then you , all three , would have enjoyed your wish , And been in future all as mute as fish . OH ! sir , replied the cobbler 's wife at ease , Do you suppose that use can hope to please , And like your ladies full of sense appear ? -LRB-B- For two were seated with his wedded dear ; -RRB-B- Perhaps my lady 'd act as you describe , But ev ` ry one such prudence do n't imbibe .
