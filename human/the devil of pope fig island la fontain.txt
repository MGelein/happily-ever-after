THE DEVIL OF POPE-FIG ISLAND La Fontain BY master Francis clearly ` tis expressed : The folks of Papimania are blessed ; True sleep for them alone it seems was made With US the copy only has been laid ; And by Saint John , if Heav ` n my life will spare , I 'll see this place where sleeping 's free from care . E ` en better still I find , for naught they do : ` Tis that employment always I pursue . Just add thereto a little honest love , And I shall be as easy as a glove . ON t ` other hand an island may be seen , Where all are hated , cursed , and full of spleen . We know them by the thinness of their face Long sleep is quite excluded from their race . SHOULD you , good reader , any person meet , With rosy , smiling looks , and cheeks replete , The form not clumsy , you may safely say , A Papimanian doubtless I survey . But if , on t ` other side , you chance to view , A meager figure , void of blooming hue , With stupid , heavy eye , and gloomy mien Conclude at once a Pope-figir , you 've seen . POPE-FIG 'S the name upon an isle bestowed , Where once a fig the silly people showed , As like the pope , and due devotion paid : -- By folly , blocks have often gods been made ! These islanders were punished for their crime ; Naught prospers , Francis tells us , in their clime ; To Lucifer was giv ` n the hateful spot , And there his country house he now has got . His underlings appear throughout the isle , Rude , wretched , poor , mean , sordid , base , and vile ; With tales , and horns , and claws , if we believe , What many say who ought not to deceive . ONE day it happened that a cunning clown Was by an imp observed , without the town , To turn the earth , which seemed to be accurst , Since ev ` ry trench was painful as the first . This youthful devil was a titled lord ; In manners simple : -- naught to be abhorred ; He might , so ignorant , be duped at ease ; As yet he 'd scarcely ventured to displease : Said he , I 'd have thee know , I was not born , Like clods to labor , dig nor sow the corn ; A devil thou in me beholdest here , Of noble race : to toil I ne'er appear . THOU know ` st full well , these fields to us belong : The islanders , it seems , had acted wrong ; And , for their crimes , the pope withdrew his cares ; Our subjects now you live , the law declares ; And therefore , fellow , I 've undoubted right , To take the produce of this field , at sight ; But I am kind , and clearly will decide The year concluded , we 'll the fruits divided . What crop , pray tell me , dost thou mean to sow ? The clod replied , my lord , what best will grow I think is Tousell ; grain of hardy fame ; The imp rejoined , I never heard its name ; What is it . Tousell , say ` st thou ? -- I agree , If good return , ` twill be the same to me ; Work fellow , work ; make haste , the ground prepare ; To dig and delve should be the rabble 's care ; Do n't think that I will ever lend a hand , Or give the slightest aid to till the land ; I 've told thee I 'm a gentleman by birth , Designed for ease : not doomed to turn the earth . Howe'er I 'll now the diff ` rent parts allot , And thus divide the produce of the plot : -- What shall above the heritage arise , I 'll leave to thee ; ` twill very well suffice ; But what is in the soil shall be my share ; To this attend , see ev ` ry thing is fair . THIS beardless corn when ripe , with joy was reaped , And then the stubble by the roots was heaped , To satisfy the lordly devil 's claim , Who thought the seed and root were just the same , And that the ear and stalk were useless parts , Which nothing made if carried to the marts : The labourer his produce housed with care ; The other to the market brought his ware , Where ridicule and laughter he received ; 'Twas nothing worth , which much his bosom grieved . QUITE mortified , the devil quickly went ; To seek our clod , and mark his discontent : The fellow had discreetly sold the corn , In straw , unthrashed , and off the money borne , Which he , with ev ` ry wily care , concealed ; The imp was duped , and nothing was revealed . Said he , thou rascal ? -- pretty tricks thou ` st played ; It seems that cheating is thy daily trade ; But I 'm a noble devil of the court , Who tricking never knew , save by report . What grain dost mean to sow th ' ensuing year ? The labourer replied , I think it clear , Instead of grain , ` twill better be to chop , And take a carrot , or a turnip crop ; You then , my lord , will surely plenty find ; And radishes , if you are so inclined . THESE carrots , radishes , and turnips too , Said t ` other , I am led to think will do ; My part shall be what ` bove the soil is found : Thine , fellow , what remains within the ground ; No war with thee I 'll have , unless constrained , And thou hast never yet of me complained . I now shall go and try to tempt a nun , For I 'm disposed to have a little fun . THE time arrived again to house the store ; The labourer collected as before ; Leaves solely to his lordship were assigned , Who sought for those a ready sale to find , But through the market ridicule was heard , And ev ` ry one around his jest preferred : -- Pray , Mister Devil , where d'ye grow these greens ? How treasure up returns from your demesnes ? ENRAGED at what was said , he hurried back , And , on the clown , proposed to make attack , Who , full of joy , was laughing with his wife , And tasting pleasantly the sweets of life . By all the pow ` rs of Hell , the demon cried , He shall the forfeit pay , I now decide ; A pretty rascal truly , master Phil : Here , pleasures you expect at will , Well , well , proceed ; gallant it while allowed ; For present I 'll remit what I had vowed ; A charming lady I 'm engaged to meet ; She 's sometimes willing : then again discreet ; But soon as I , in cuckold 's row , have placed Her ninny husband , I 'll return in haste , And then so thoroughly I 'll trim you o ` er , Such wily tricks you 'll never practice more ; We 'll see who best can use his claws and nails , And from the fields obtain the richest sales . Corn , carrots , radishes , or what you will : -- Crop as you like , and show your utmost skill No stratagems howe'er with culture blend ; I 'll take my portion from the better end ; Within a week , remember , I 'll be here , And recollect : -- you 've every thing to fear . AMAZED at what the lordly devil said , The clod could naught reply , so great his dread ; But at the gasconade Perretta smiled , Who kept his house and weary hours beguiled , A sprightly clever lass , with prying eye , Who , when a shepherdess , could more descry , Than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain , If other views or points she sought to gain . Said she , weep not , I 'll undertake at ease , To gull this novice-devil as I please ; He 's young and ignorant ; has nothing seen ; Thee ; from his rage , I thoroughly will skreen ; My little finger , if I like can show More malice than his head and body know . THE day arrived , our labourer , not brave , Concealed himself , but not in vault nor cave ; He plunged within a vase extremely large , Where holy-water always was in charge ; No demon would have thought to find him there , So well the clod had chosen his repair ; In sacred stoles he muffled up his skin , And , ` bove the water , only kept his chin ; There we will leave him , while the priests profound Repeated Vade retro round and round . PERRETTA at the house remained to greet The lordly devil whom she hoped to cheat . He soon appeared ; when with dishevelled hair , And flowing tears , as if o ` erwhelmed with care , She sallied forth , and bitterly complained , How oft by Phil she had been scratched and caned ; Said she , the wretch has used me very ill ; Of cruelty he has obtained his fill ; For God 's sake try , my lord , to get away : Just now I heard the savage fellow say , He 'd with his claws your lordship tear and slash : See , only see , my lord , he made this gash ; On which she showed : -- what you will guess , no doubt , And put the demon presently to rout , Who crossed himself and trembled with affright : He 'd never seen nor heard of such a sight , Where scratch from claws or nails had so appeared ; His fears prevailed , and off he quickly steered ; Perretta left , who , by her friends around , Was complimented on her sense profound , That could so well the demon 's snares defeat ; The clergy too pronounced her plan discrete .
