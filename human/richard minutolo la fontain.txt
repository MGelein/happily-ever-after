RICHARD MINUTOLO La Fontain IN ev ` ry age , at Naples , we are told , Intrigue and gallantry reign uncontrolled ; With beauteous objects in abundance blessed . No country round so many has possessed ; Such fascinating charms the FAIR disclose , That irresistibly soft passion flows . ` MONG these a belle , enchanting to behold , Was loved by one , of birth and store of gold ; Minutolo -LRB-B- and Richard -RRB-B- was his name , In Cupid 's train a youth of brilliant fame : ` Tween Rome and Paris none was more gallant , And num ` rous hearts were for him known to pant . CATELLA -LRB-B- thus was called our lady fair , -RRB-B- So long , howe'er , resisted Richard 's snare , That prayers , and vows , and promises were vain ; A favor Minutolo could not gain . At length , our hero weary , coldness showed , And dropt attendance , since no kindness flowed ; Pretended to be cured : -- another sought , And feigned her charms his tender heart had caught : Catella laughed , but jealousy was nigh ; 'Twas for her friend that now He heaved the sigh . THESE dames together met , and Richard too , The gay gallant a glowing picture drew , Of certain husbands , lovers , prudes , and wives ; Who led in secret most lascivious lives . Though none he named , Catella was amazed ; His hints suspicions of her husband raised ; And such her agitation and affright , That , anxious to procure more certain light , In haste she took Minutolo aside , And begged the names he would not from her hide , With all particulars , from first to last : -- Her ardent wish to know whate'er had passed . SO long your reign , said Richard , o ` er my mind , Deny I could not , howsoe'er inclined ; With Mrs. Simon often is your spouse ; Her character no doubt your spleen will rouse ; I 've no design , observe to give offence , But , when I see your int ` rest in suspense , I can not silent keep ; though , were I still A slave , devoted wholly to your will , As late I moved , I would not drop a word Mistrust of lovers may not be absurd ; Besides , you 'd fancy other motives led To tell you of your husband what was said ; But heav ` n be praised , of you I nothing want ; My object 's plain -- no more the fond gallant . I 'VE lately certain information had , Your spouse -LRB-B- I scarcely thought the man so bad , -RRB-B- Has with the lady an appointment made ; At Jack 's nice bagnio he will meet the jade . NOW clearly Jack 's not rich , and there 's no doubt ; A hundred ducats give , and -- ALL will out ; Let him but have a handsome sum in view , And any thing you wish , be sure he 'll do ; You then can manage ev ` ry way so well , That , at the place assigned to meet his belle , You 'll take this truant husband by surprise ; -- Permit me in this nice affair to advise . THE lady has agreed , you will remark , That in a room where ev ` ry part is dark , -LRB-B- Perhaps to ` scape the keeper 's prying sight , Or shame directs exclusion of the light , -RRB-B- She will receive your gay inconstant spouse ; Now , take her place ; the case deceit allows ; Make Jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price ; A hundred ducats give , is my advice ; He 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns ; Think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains ; Do what you wish , and utter not a word ; To speak , assuredly would be absurd ; ` Twould spoil the whole ; destroy the project quite ; Attend , and see if all things be not right . THE project pleased Catella to the soul ; Her wrath , no longer able to controul , She Richard stopt ; enough , enough , she cried ; I fully understand : -- leave me to guide ; I 'll play the fellow and his wanton lass A pretty trick-shall all their art surpass , Unless the string gives way and spoils my scheme ; What , take me for a nincompoop ? -- they dream . THIS said , she sought excuse to get away , And went in quest of Jack without delay . The keeper , howsoe'er , a hint had got ; Minutolo had schooled him for the plot ; Oft cash does wonders , and , if such the case In France or Britain , when conferred a grace , The bribe is taken , and the truth abused , In Italy it will not be refused ; There this sole quiver Cupid useful finds , -- A purse well stored -- all binds , gunlocks , or blinds : Jack took the pelf from Richard and the dame ; Had Satan offered -- ` twould have been the same . In short , Minutolo had full success , All came about , and marked the spark 's address . THE lady had at first some warm dispute To many questions Jack was even mute ; But when he saw the golden charms unmasked , Far more he promised than Catella asked . THE time of rendezvous arrived , our spark To Jack 's repaired , and found the room quite dark ; So well arranged , no crevice could he find , Through which the light might hurt what he designed . NOT long he waited , ere our jealous dame , Who longed to find her faithless husband , came , Most thoroughly prepared his ears to greet . Jack brought the couple presently to meet . The lady found , howe'er , not what she sought : No guilty spouse , nor Mrs. Simon caught ; But wily Richard , who , without alarms , In silence took Catella in his arms . What further passed between the easy pair , Think what you will , I mean not to declare ; The lover certainly received delight The lady showed no terror nor affright ; On neither side a syllable was dropt With care Minutolo his laughter stopt ; Though difficult , our spark succeeded well ; No words of mine can Richard 's pleasure tell . His fav ` rite beauteous belle he now possessed , And triumphed where so oft he 'd been repressed , Yet fondly hoped her pardon he should get , Since they together had so gaily met . AT length , the fair could no longer contain : Vile wretch , she cried , I 've borne too much ` tis plain ; I 'm not the fav ` rite whom thou had ` st in view : To tear thy eyes out justly were thy due , ` Tis this , indeed , that makes thee silent keep , Each morn feign sickness , and pretend to sleep , Thyself reserving doubtless for amours : -- Speak , villain ! say , of charms have I less stores ? Or what has Mrs. Simon more than I ? A wanton wench , in tricks so wondrous sly ! Where my love less ? though truly now I hate ; Would that I 'd seen thee hung , thou wretch ingrate ! MINUTOLO , while thus Catella spoke , Caressed her much , but silence never broke ; A kiss e ` en tried to gain , without success ; She struggled , and refused to acquiesce ; Begone ! said she , nor treat me like a child ; Stand off ! -- away ! -- thy taction is defiled ; My tears express an injured woman 's grief ; No more thy wife I 'll be , but seek relief ; Return my fortune -- go : -- thy mistress seek ; To be so constant : -- How was I so weak ? It surely would be nothing more than right , Were Richard I to see this very night , Who adoration constantly has paid : -- You much deserve to be a cuckold made ; I 'm half inclined , I vow , to do the worst . At this our arch gallant with laughter burst . What impudence ! -- You mock me too ? she cried Let 's see , with blushes if his face be dyed ? When from his arms she sprang , a window sought ; The shutters ope 'd , and then a view she caught ; Minutolo , her lover ! \* \* \* what surprise ! Pale , faint , she instant grew , and closed her eyes : Who would have thought , said she , thou wert so base ? I 'm lost ! \* \* \* for ever sunk in dire disgrace ! WHO 'LL , know it ? Richard earnestly replied ; In Jack 's concealment we may both confide ; Excuse the trick I 've played and ne'er repine ; Address , force , treachery , in love combine ; All are permitted when intrigue 's the word ; To hold the contrary were quite absurd . Till stratagem was used I naught could gain , But looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain . I 've paid myself ; -- Would you have done it ? -- No ; ` Tis all as might be wished ; -- come , smiles bestow ; I 'm satisfied , the fault was not with you . In this , to make you wretched , naught I view ; Why sigh and groan ? -- What numbers could I name , Who would be happy to be served the same . HIS reas ` ning yet could not the belle appease ; She wept , and sought by tears her mind to ease ; Affliction highly added to her charms ; Minutolo still gave her new alarms ; He took her hand , which she at once withdrew : Away , she cried ; no longer me pursue ; Be satisfied ; you surely do n't desire That I assistance from the house require , Or rouse the neighbors with my plaintive cries I 'll ev ` ry thing declare without disguise . SUCH folly do n't commit , replied the spark ; Your wisest plan is nothing to remark : The world at present is become so vile , If you the truth divulge , they 'll only smile ; Not one a word of treachery would believe , But think you came -- and money to receive : Suppose , besides , it reached your husband 's ears ; Th ' effect has reason to excite your fears ; ` Twould give displeasure and occasion strife : Would you in duels wish to risk his life ? Whatever makes you with him disagree , At all events , I 'm full as bad as he . THESE reasons with Catella greatly weighed Since things , continued he , are thus displayed ; And can not be repaired , console your mind ; A perfect being never was designed . If , howsoe'er you will \* \* \* but say no more ; Such thoughts for ever banish , I implore . ` Mid all my perseverance , zeal , and art , I nothing got but frowns that pierced the heart : ` Twill now on you depend if pleasure prove This day imperfect , ere from hence we move . What more remains to do ? the worst is past ; ` TisS step the first that costs , however classed . So well Minutolo preferred his suit , The lady with him more would not dispute , With downcast eyes she listened to his prayer , And looked disposed to tranquilize his care ; From easy freedom soon he ` gan to soar ; A smile received : -- a kiss bestowed and more : At length , the lady passed resistance by , And all conceded , e ` en without a sigh . OUR hero felt a thousand times more blessed Than when he first the beauteous fair caressed ; For when a flame reciprocal is raised , The bliss redoubles , and by all is praised . THUS Richard pleasantly employed his time , Contented lived , concentring joys sublime . A sample , now , we have given of his pow ` rs , And who would wish for more delightful hours ? O grant , kind heav ` n ! that I the like may meet , And ever prove so wary and discreet .
