THE LITTLE BELL La Fontain HOW weak is man ! how changeable his mind ! His promises are naught , too oft we find ; I vowed -LRB-B- I hope in tolerable verse , -RRB-B- Again no idle story to rehearse . And whence this promise ? -- Not two days ago ; I 'm quite confounded ; better I should know : A rhymer hear then , who himself can boast , Quite steady for -- a minute at the most . The pow ` rs above could PRUDENCE ne'er design ; For those who fondly court the SISTERS NINE . Some means to please they 've got , you will confess ; But none with certainty the charm possess . If , howsoever , I were doomed to find Such lines as fully would content the mind : Though I should fail in matter , still in art ; I might contrive some pleasure to impart . LET 'S see what we are able to obtain : -- A bachelor resided in Touraine . A sprightly youth , who oft the maids beset , And liked to prattle to the girls he met , With sparkling eyes , white teeth , and easy air , Plain russet petticoat and flowing hair , Beside a rivulet , while Io round , With little bell that gave a tinkling sound , On herbs her palate gratified at will , And gazed and played , and fondly took her fill . AMONG the rustic nymphs our spark perceived A charming girl , for whom his bosom heaved ; Too young , however , to feel the poignant smart , By Cupid oft inflicted on the heart . I will not say thirteen 's an age unfit The contrary most fully I admit ; The LAW supposes -LRB-B- such its prudent fears -RRB-B- Maturity at still more early years ; But this apparently refers to towns , While LOVE was born for groves , and lawns , and downs . THE youth exerted ev ` ry art to please ; But all in vain : he only seemed to teaze : Whate'er he said , however nicely graced , Ill-humour , inexperience , or distaste , Induced the belle , unlearned in Cupid 's book ; To treat his passion with a froward look . BELIEVING ev ` ry artifice in love Was tolerated by the pow ` rs above , One eve he turned a heifer from the rest ; Conducted by the girl his thoughts possessed ; The others left , not counted by the fair , -LRB-B- Youth seldom shows the necessary care , -RRB-B- With easy , loit ` ring steps the cottage sought , Where ev ` ry night they usually were brought . HER mother , more experienced than the maid , Observed , that from the cattle one had strayed ; The girl was scolded much , and sent to find The heifer indiscreetly left behind . Fair Isabella gave a vent to tears ; Invoked sweet echo to disperse her fears : Solicited with fervent , piercing cry , To tell her where lorn Io she might spy , Whose little bell the spark deprived of sound ; When he withdrew her from the herd around . THE lover now the tinkling metal shook ; The path that t ` wards it led the charmer took . The well known note was pleasing to her ear ; Without suspecting treachery was near , She followed to a wood , both deep and large , In hopes at least she might regain her charge . GUESS her surprise , good reader , when she heard , A lover 's voice , who would not be deterred . Said he , fair maid whene'er the heart 's on fire , ` Tis all permitted that can quench desire . On this , with piercing cries she rent the air ; But no one came : -- she sunk to dire despair . YE beauteous dames avoid the Sylvan shade ; Dread dangers solitary woods pervade .
