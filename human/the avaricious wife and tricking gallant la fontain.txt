THE AVARICIOUS WIFE AND TRICKING GALLANT La Fontain WHO knows the world will never feel surprise , When men are duped by artful women 's eyes ; Though death his weapon freely will unfold ; Love 's pranks , we find , are ever ruled by gold . To vain coquettes I doubtless here allude ; But spite of arts with which they 're oft endued ; I hope to show -LRB-B- our honor to maintain , -RRB-B- We can , among a hundred of the train , Catch one at least , and play some cunning trick : -- For instance , take blithe Gulphar 's wily nick , Who gained -LRB-B- old soldier-like -RRB-B- his ardent aim , And gratis got an avaricious dame . LOOK well at this , ye heroes of the sword , Howe'er with wily freaks your heads be stored , Beyond a doubt , at court I now could find , A host of lovers of the Gulphar kind . To Gasperin 's so often went our wight , The wife at length became his sole delight , Whose youth and beauty were by all confessed ; But , ` midst these charms , such av ` rice she possessed , The warmest love was checked -- a thing not rare , In modern times at least , among the FAIR . ` Tis true , as I 've already said , with such Sighs naught avail , and promises not much ; Without a purse , who wishes should express , Would vainly hope to gain a soft caress . The god of love no other charm employs , Then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys ; From whose gay shops more cuckolds we behold , Than heroes sallied from Troy 's horse of old . BUT to our lady 's humor let 's adhere ; Sighs passed for naught : they entered not her ear ; 'Twas speaking only would the charmer please , The reader , without doubt , my meaning sees ; Gay Gulphar plainly spoke , and named a sum A hundred pounds , she listened : -- was o ` ercome . OUR wight the cash by Gasperin was lent ; And then the husband to the country went , Without suspecting that his loving mate , Designed with horns to ornament his pate . THE money artful Gulphar gave the dame , While friends were round who could observe the same ; Here , said the spark , a hundred pounds receive , ` TisS for your spouse : -- the cash with you I leave . The lady fancied what the swain had said , Was policy , and to concealment led . NEXT morn our belle regaled the arch gallant , Fulfilled his promise : -- and his eager want . Day after day he followed up the game ; For cash he took , and int ` rest on the same ; Good payers get , we always may conclude , Full measure served , whatever is pursued . WHEN Gasperin returned , our crafty wight , Before the wife addressed her spouse at sight ; Said he the cash I 've to your lady paid , Not having -LRB-B- as I feared -RRB-B- required its aid ; To save mistakes , pray cross it in your book ; The lady , thunderstruck , with terror shook ; Allowed the payment ; 'twas a case too clear ; In truth for character she ` gan to fear . But most howe'er she grudged the surplus joy , Bestowed on such a vile , deceitful boy . THE loss was doubtless great in ev ` ry view Around the town the wicked Gulphar flew ; In all the streets , at every house to tell , How nicely he had trick 'd the greedy belle . To blame him useless ` twere you must allow ; The French such frolicks readily avow .
