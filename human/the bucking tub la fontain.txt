THE BUCKING-TUB La Fontain IF once in love , you 'll soon invention find And not to cunning tricks and freaks be blind ; The youngest ` prentice , when he feels the dart , Grows wondrous shrewd , and studies wily art . This passion never , we perceive , remains In want from paucity of scheming brains . The god of hearts so well exerts his force , That he receives his dues as things of course . A bucking-tub , of which a tale is told , Will prove the case , and this I 'll now unfold ; ParticularsS I heard some days ago , From one who seemed each circumstance to know . WITHIN a country town , no matter where , Its appellation nothing would declare , A cooper and his wife , whose name was Nan , Kept house , and through some difficulties ran . Though scanty were their means , LOVE thither flew ; And with him brought a friend to take a view ; 'Twas Cuckoldom accompanied the boy , Two gods most intimate , who like to toy , And , never ceremonious , seek to please Go where they will , still equally at ease ; ` Tis all for them good lodging , fare , or bed ; And , hut or palace , pleasantly they tread . IT happened then , a spark this fair caressed , And , when he hoped most fully to be blessed , When all was ready to complete the scene , And on a point : -- if naught should intervene Not NAMED howe'er will quite enough suffice , When suddenly the husband , by surprise , Returned from drinking at an ale-house near , just when , just when : -- the rest is pretty clear . THEY curst his coming ; trouble o ` er them spread ; Naught could be done but hide the lover 's head ; Beneath a bucking-tub , in utmost haste , Within the court , our gay gallant was placed . THE husband , as he entered , loudly cried , I 've sold our bucking-tub . The wife replied , What price , I pray ? -- Three crowns rejoined the man ; Then thou ` rt a silly ass , said mistress Nan ; To-day , by my address , I 've gained a crown , And sold the same for twenty shillings down : My bargain luckily the first was made ; The buyer , -LRB-B- who of flaws is much afraid -RRB-B- Examines now if ev ` ry part is tight ; He 's in the tub to see if all be right . What , blockhead , would ` st thou do without thy wife ? Thou huntest taverns while she works for life ; But necessary ` tis for her to act , When thou art out , or naught would be exact . No pleasure ever yet received have I ; But take my word , to get it now I 'll try . Gallants are plenty ; husbands should have wives ; That , like themselves , lead gay or sober lives . I PRYTHEE softly , wife , the husband said ; Come , come , sir , leave the tub , there 's naught to dread ; When you are out , I 'll ev ` ry quarter scrape , Then try if water from it can escape ; I 'll warrant it to be as good as nice , And nothing can be better worth the price . OUT came the lover ; in the husband went ; Scraped here and there , and tried if any vent ; With candle in his hand looked round and round , Not dreaming once that LOVE without was found . But nothing he could see of what was done ; And while the cooper sought to overrun The various parts , and by the tub was hid , The gods already noticed thither slid ; A job was by the deities proposed , That highly pleased the couple when disclosed ; A very diff ` rent work from what within The husband had , who scraped with horrid din , And rubbed , and scrubbed , and beat so very well , Fresh courage took our gay gallant and belle ; They now resumed the thread so sadly lost , When , by the cooper 's coming , all was crossed . THE reader wo n't require to know the rest ; What passed perhaps may easily be guessed . ` Tis quite enough , my thesis I have proved ; The artful trick our pair with raptures moved . Nor one nor t ` other was a ` prentice new ; A lover be : -- and wiles you 'll soon pursue .
