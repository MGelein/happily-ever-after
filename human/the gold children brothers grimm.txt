85 The Gold-Children BrothersS Grimm There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little cottage , and who earned their bread by fishing , and always lived from hand to mouth . But it came to pass one day when the man was sitting by the water-side , and casting his net , that he drew out a fish entirely of gold . As he was looking at the fish , full of astonishment , it began to speak and said , `` Hark you , fisherman , if you will throw me back again into the water , I will change your little hut into a splendid castle . '' Then the fisherman answered , `` Of what use is a castle to me , if I have nothing to eat ? '' The gold fish continued , `` That shall be taken care of , there will be a cupboard in the castle in which , when you open it , shall be dishes of the most delicate meats , and as many of them as you can desire . '' `` If that be true , '' said the man , `` then I can well do you a favor . '' `` Yes , '' said the fish , `` there is , however , the condition that you shall disclose to no one in the world , whosoever he may be , whence your good luck has come , if you speak but one single word , all will be over . '' Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water , and went home . But where his hovel had formerly stood , now stood a great castle . He opened wide his eyes , entered , and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes , sitting in a splendid room , and she was quite delighted , and said , `` Husband , how has all this come to pass ? It suits me very well . '' `` Yes , '' said the man , `` it suits me too , but I am frightfully hungry , just give me something to eat . '' Said the wife , `` But I have got nothing and do n't know where to find anything in this new house . '' `` There is no need of your knowing , '' said the man , `` for I see yonder a great cupboard , just unlock it . '' When she opened it , there stood cakes , meat , fruit , wine , quite a bright prospect . Then the woman cried joyfully , `` What more can you want , my dear ? '' and they sat down , and ate and drank together . When they had had enough , the woman said , `` But husband , whence come all these riches ? '' `` Alas , '' answered he , `` do not question me about it , for I dare not tell you anything ; if I disclose it to any one , then all our good fortune will fly . '' `` Very good , '' said she , `` if I am not to know anything , then I do not want to know anything . '' However , she was not in earnest ; she never rested day or night , and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught , and to which in return he had given its liberty . And as soon as the secret was out , the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared , they were once more in the old fisherman 's hut , and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish . But fortune would so have it , that he once more drew out the golden fish . `` Listen , '' said the fish , `` if you will throw me back into the water again , I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats ; only be firm , for your life 's sake do n't reveal from whom you have it , or you will lose it all again ! '' `` I will take good care , '' answered the fisherman , and threw the fish back into the water . Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence , and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune , but curiosity left her no peace , so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass , and how he had managed to secure it . The man kept silence for a short time , but at last she made him so angry that he broke out , and betrayed the secret . In an instant the castle disappeared , and they were back again in their old hut . `` Now you have got what you want , '' said he ; `` and we can gnaw at a bare bone again . '' `` Ah , '' said the woman , `` I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come , for then I have no peace . '' The man went back to fish , and after a while he chanced to draw out the gold fish for a third time . `` Listen , '' said the fish , `` I see very well that I am fated to fall into your hands , take me home and cut me into six pieces ; give your wife two of them to eat , two to your horse and bury two of them in the ground , then they will bring you a blessing . '' The fisherman took the fish home with him , and did as it had bidden him . It came to pass , however , that from the two pieces that were
