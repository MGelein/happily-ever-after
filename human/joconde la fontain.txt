JOCONDE La Fontain IN Lombardy 's fair land , in days of yore , Once dwelt a prince , of youthful charms , a store ; Each FAIR , with anxious look , his favors sought , And ev ` ry heart within his net was caught . Quite proud of beauteous form and smart address , In which the world was led to acquiesce , He cried one day , while ALL attention paid , I 'll bet a million , Nature never made Beneath the sun , another man like me , Whose symmetry with mine can well agree . If such exist , and here will come , I swear I 'll show him ev ` ry lib ` ral princely care . A noble Roman , who the challenge heard , This answer gave the king his soul preferr 'd -- Great prince , if you would see a handsome man , To have my brother here should be your plan ; A frame more perfect Nature never gave ; But this to prove , your courtly dames I crave ; May judge the fact , when I 'm convinc 'd they 'll find : Like you , the youth will please all womankind ; And since so many sweets at once may cloy , ` Twere well to have a partner in your joy . THE king , surpris 'd , expressed a wish to view This brother , form 'd by lines so very true ; We 'll see , said he , if here his charms divine Attract the heart of ev ` ry nymph , like mine ; And should success attend our am ` rous lord , To you , my friend , full credit we 'll accord . AWAY the Roman flew , Joconde to get , -LRB-B- So nam 'd was he in whom these features met ; -RRB-B- ` Midst woods and lawns , retir 'd from city strife , And lately wedded to a beauteous wife ; If bless 'd , I know not ; but with such a fair , On him must rest the folly to despair . THE Roman courtier came , his business told The brilliant offers from the monarch bold ; His mission had success , but still the youth Distraction felt , which ` gan to shake his truth ; A pow ` rful monarch 's favor there he view 'd ; A partner here , with melting tears bedew 'd ; And while he wavered on the painful choice , She thus address 'd her spouse with plaintive voice : CAN you , Joconde , so truly cruel prove , To quit my fervent love in courts to move ? The promises of kings are airy dreams , And scarcely last beyond the day 's extremes By watchful , anxious care alone retain 'd , And lost , through mere caprice , as soon as gain 'd . If weary of my charms , alas ! you feel , Still think , my love , what joys these woods conceal ; Here dwell around tranquillity and ease ; The streams ' soft murmurs , and the balmy breeze , Invite to sleep ; these vales where breathe the doves , All , all , my dear Joconde , renew our loves ; You laugh ! -- Ah ! cruel , go , expose thy charms , Grim death will quickly spare me these alarms ! JOCONDE 'S reply our records ne'er relate , Nor what he did , nor how he left his mate ; And since contemp ` raries decline the task ; ` Twere folly , such details of me to ask . We 're told , howe'er , when ready to depart , With flowing tears she press 'd him to her heart ; And on his arm a brilliant bracelet plac 'd , With hair around her picture nicely trac 'd ; This guard in full remembrance of my love , She cried ; -- then clasped her hands to pow ` rs above . TO see such dire distress , and poignant grief , Might lead to think , soon death would bring relief ; But I , who know full well the female mind , At best oft doubt affliction of the kind . JOCONDE set out at length ; but that same morn ; As on he mov 'd , his soul with anguish torn , He found the picture he had quite forgot , Then turn 'd his steed , and back began to trot . While musing what excuse to make his mate , At home he soon arriv 'd , and op 'd the gate ; Alighted unobserv 'd , ran up the stairs ; And ent ` ring to the lady unawares , He found this darling rib , so full of charms ; Intwin 'd within a valet 's brawny arms ! ` MIDST first emotions of the husband 's ire ; To stab them while asleep he felt desire ; Howe'er , he nothing did ; the courteous wight ; In this dilemma , clearly acted right ; The less of such misfortunes said is best ; ` Twere well the soul of feeling to divest ; Their lives , through pity , or prudential care ; With much reluctance , he was led to spare ; Asleep he left the pair , for if awake , In honor , he a diff ` rent step would take . -- Had any smart gallant supplied my place , Said he , I might put up with this disgrace ; But naught consoles the thought of such a beast ; Dan Cupid wantons , or is blind at least ; A bet , or some such whim , induc 'd the god , To give his sanction to amours so odd . THIS perfidy Joconde so much dismay 'd ; His spirits droop 'd , his lilies ` gan to fade ; No more he look 'd the charmer he had been ; And when the court 's gay dames his face had seen ; They cried , Is this the beauty , we were told , Would captivate each heart , or young or old ? Why , he 's the jaundice ; ev ` ry view displays The mien of one , -- just fasted forty days ! WITH secret pleasure , this , AstolphusS learn 'd ; The Roman , for his brother , risks discern 'd , Whose secret griefs were carefully conceal 'd , -LRB-B- And these Joconde could never wish reveal 'd ; -RRB-B- Yet , spite of gloomy looks and hollow eyes , His graceful features pierc 'd the wan disguise , Which fail 'd to please , alone through want of life , Destroy 'd by thinking on a guilty wife . THE god of love , in pity to our swain , At last revok 'd BLACK CARE 'S corroding reign ; For , doubtless , in his views he oft was cross 'd , While such a lover to the world was lost . THE hero of our tale , at length , we find Was well rewarded : LOVE again proved kind ; For , musing as he walk 'd alone one day , And pass 'd a gall ` ry , -LRB-B- held a secret way , -RRB-B- A voice in plaintive accents caught his ear , And from the neighb ` ring closet came , 'twas clear : My dear Curtade , my only hope below , In vain I love ; -- you colder , colder grow ; While round no fair can boast so fine a face , And numbers wish they might supply thy place , Whilst thou with some gay page prefer ` st a bet , Or game of dice with some low , vulgar set , To meeting me alone ; and when just now To thee I sent , with rage thou knit ` st thy brow , And Dorimene , with ev ` ry curse abus 'd Then played again , since better that amus 'd , And left me here , as if not worth a thought , Or thou didst scorn what I so fondly sought . ASTONISHMENT , at once , our Roman seiz 'd ; But who 's the fair that thus her bosom eas 'd ? Or , who 's the gay Adonis , form 'd to bless ? You 'd try a day , and not the secret guess , The queen 's the belle : -- and , doubtless you will stare , The king 's own dwarf the idol of her care ! THE Roman saw a crevice in the wood , Through which he took a peep from where he stood ; To Dorimene our lovers left the key , Which she had dropt when lately forc 'd to flee , And this Joconde pick 'd up , a lucky hit , Since he could use it when he best thought fit . It seems , said he , I 'm not alone in name , And since a prince so handsome is the same , Although a valet has supplied my place , Yet see , the queen prefers a dwarf 's embrace . THIS thought consol 'd so well , -- his youthful rays Returned , and e ` en excelled his former days ; And those who lately ridicul 'd his charms , Now anxious seem 'd to revel in his arms 'Twas who could have him , -- even prudes grew kind ; -- By many belles Astolphus was resign 'd ; Though still the king retain 'd enough , 'twas seen ; -- But now let us resume the dwarf and queen . OUR Roman , having satisfied his eyes , At length withdrew , confounded by surprise . Who follows courts , must oft with care conceal , And scarcely know what sight and ears reveal . YET , by Joconde the king was lov 'd so well , What now he 'd seen he greatly wish 'd to tell ; But , since to princes full respect is due , And what concerns them , howsoever true , If thought displeasing , should not be dispos 'd In terms direct , but obviously dispos 'd , To catch the mind , Joconde at ease detail 'd , From days of yore to those he now bewail 'd , The names of emp ` rors and of kings , whose brows , By wily wives , were crown 'd with leafless boughs ! And who , without repining , view 'd their lot , Nor bad made worse , but thought things best forgot . E ` en I , who now your majesty address , Continued he , am sorry to confess , The very day I left my native earth , To wait upon a prince of royal birth , Was forced t ` acknowledge cuckoldom among The gods who rule the matrimonial throng , And sacrifice thereto with aching heart Cornuted heads dire torments oft impart : THE tale he then detail 'd , that rais 'd his spleen ; And what within the closet he had seen ; The king replied , I will not be so rude , To question what so clearly you have view 'd ; Yet , since ` twere better full belief to gain , A glimpse of such a fact I should obtain , Pray bring me thither ; instantly our wight ; Astolphus led , where both his ears and sight Full proof receiv 'd , which struck the prince with awe ; Who stood amaz 'd at what he heard and saw . But soon reflection 's all-convincing pow ' r Induced the king vexation to devour ; True courtier-like , who dire misfortunes braves , Feels sprouting horns , yet smiles at fools and knaves : Our wives , said he , a pretty trick have play 'd , And shamefully the marriage bed betray 'd ; Let us the compliment return , my friend , And round the country our amours extend ; But , in our plan the better to succeed , Our names we 'll change ; no servants we shall need ; -- For your relation I desire to pass , So you 'll true freedom use ; then with a lass We more at ease shall feel , more pleasure gain ; Than if attended by my usual train . JOCONDE with joy the king 's proposal heard ; On which the latter with his friend conferr 'd ; Said he , ` twere surely right to have a book , In which to place the names of those we hook , The whole arrang 'd according to their rank , And I 'll engage no page remains a blank , But ere we leave the range of our design , E ` en scrup ` lous dames shall to our wish incline , Our persons handsome , with engaging air , And sprightly , brilliant wit no trifling share , -- ` Twere strange , possessing such engaging charms , They should not tumble freely in our arms . THE baggage ready , and the paper-book , our smart gallants the road together took , But ` twould be vain to number their amours ; With beauties , Cupid favored them by scores ; Blessed , if only seen by either swain , And doubly bless 'd who could attention gain : Nor wife of alderman , nor wife of mayor , Of justice , nor of governor was there , Who did not anxiously desire her name Might straight be entered in the book of fame ! HeartsS , which before were thought as cold as ice , Now warm 'd at once and melted in a trice . SOME infidel , I fancy , in my ear Would whisper-probabilities , I fear , Are rather wanting to support the fact ; However perfectly gallants may act , To gain a heart requires full many a day If more be requisite I can not say ; ` Tis not my plan to dupe or young or old , But such to me , howe'er the tale is told , And Ariosto never truth forsakes ; Yet , if at ev ` ry step a writer takes , He 's closely question 'd as to time and place , He ne'er can end his work with easy grace . To those , from whom just credence I receive , Their tales I promise fully to believe . AT length , when our advent ` rers round had play 'd , And danc 'd with ev ` ry widow , wife , and maid , The full blown lily and the tender rose , Astolphus said , though clearly I suppose , We can as many hearts securely link , As e ` er we like , yet better now , I think , To stop a while in some delightful spot , And that before satiety we 've got ; For true it is , with love as with our meat ; If we , variety of dishes eat , The doctors tell us inj ` ry will ensue , And too much raking none can well pursue . Let us some pleasing fair-one then engage , To serve us both : -- enough she 'll prove I 'll wage . JOCONDE at once replied , with all my heart , And I a lady know who 'll take the part ; She 's beautiful ; possesses store of wit ; And is the wife of one above a cit . WITH such to meddle would be indiscreet , Replied the king , more charms we often meet , Beneath a chambermaid or laundress ' dress , Than any rich coquette can well possess . Besides , with those , less form is oft requir 'd , While dames of quality must be admir 'd ; Their whims complied with , though suspicions rise ; And ev ` ry hour produces fresh surprise , But this sweet charmer of inferior birth A treasure proves ; a source of bliss on earth . No trouble she to carry here nor there ; No balls she visits , and requires no care ; The conquest easy , we may talk or not ; The only difficulty we have got , Is how to find one , we may faithful view ; So let us choose a girl , to love quite new . SINCE these , replied the YOUTH , your thoughts appear , What think you of our landlord 's daughter here ? That she 's a perfect virgin I 've no doubt , Nor can we find a chaster round about ; Her very doll more innocent wo n't prove , Than this sweet nymph design 'd with us to move . THE scheme our prince 's approbation met ; The very girl , said he , I wish 'd to get ; This night be our attack ; and if her heart Surrenders when our wishes we impart , But one perplexity will then remain ; ` TisS who her virgin favors shall obtain ? The honor 's all a whim , and I , as king , At once assuredly should claim this thing : The rest ` tis very easy to arrange ; As matters suit we presently can change . IF ceremony ` twere , Joconde replied , All cavil then we quickly could decide ; Precedence would no doubt with you remain : But this is quite another case ` tis plain ; And equity demands that we agree , By lot to settle which the man shall be . THE noble youths no arguments would spare , And each contended for the spoiler 's care ; Howe'er Joconde obtained the lucky hit , And first embrac 'd this fancied dainty bit . THE girl who was the noble rival 's aim , That ev ` ning to the room for something came ; Our heroes gave her instantly a chair , And lavished praises on her face and hair ; A diamond ring soon sparkled in her eyes ; Its pleasing pow ` rs at sight obtain 'd the prize . THE bargain made , she , in the dead of night , When silence reign 'd and all was void of light , With careful steps their anxious wish obey 'd , And ` tween them both , she presently was laid ; 'Twas Paradise they thought , where all is nice , And our young spark believ 'd he broke the ice . THE folly I forgive him ; -- ` tis in vain On this to reason -- idle to complain ; The WISE have oft been dup 'd it is confest , And Solomon it seems among the rest . But gay Joconde felt nothing of the kind , A secret pleasure glow 'd within his mind ; He thought Astolphus wond ` rous bliss had missed , And that himself alone the fair had kiss 'd ; A clod howe'er , who liv 'd within the place , Had , prior to the Roman , her embrace . THE soft amour extended through the night , The girl was pleas 'd , and all proceeded right ; The foll ` wing night , the next , 'twas still the same ; Young Clod at length her coldness ` gan to blame ; And as he felt suspicious of the act , He watch 'd her steps and verified the fact : A quarrel instantly between them rose ; Howe'er the fair , his anger to compose , And favor not to lose , on honor vow 'd , That when the sparks were gone , and time allow 'd , She would oblige his craving , fierce desire ; -- To which the village lad replied with ire : -- Pray what care I for any tavern guest , Of either sex ; to you I now protest , If I be not indulg 'd this very night , I 'll publish your amours in mere despite . HOW can we manage it , replied the belle , I 'm quite distressed -- indeed the truth to tell , I 've promis 'd them this night to come again , And if I fail , no doubt can then remain , But I shall lose the ring , their pledg 'd reward , Which would , you know for me , be very hard . TO you I wish the ring , replied young Clod , But do they sleep in bed , or only nod ? Tell me , pray ; oh , said she , they sleep most sound ; But then between them plac 'd shall I be found , And while the one amidst Love 's frolicks sports , The other quiet lies , or Morpheus courts . On hearing this the rustick lad proposed , To visit her when others ' eyes were closed . Oh ! never risk it , quickly she replied ; ` Twere folly to attempt it by their side . He answer 'd , never fear , but only leave The door ajar , and me they 'll not perceive . THE door she left exactly as he said ; The spark arriv 'd , and then approach 'd the bed , -LRB-B- 'Twas near the foot , -RRB-B- then ` tween the sheets he slid , But God knows how he lay , or what he did . Astolphus and Joconde ne'er smelt a rat , Nor ever dreamt of what their girl was at , At length when each had turn 'd and op 'd his eyes , Continual movement fill 'd him with surprise . The monarch softly said : -- why how is this ? My friend has eaten something , for in bliss , He revels on , and truly much I fear , His health will show , it may be bought too dear . THIS very sentiment Joconde bethought ; But Clod a breathing moment having caught , Resum 'd his fun , and that so oft would seek : He gratified his wishes for a week ; Then watching carefully , he found once more ; Our noble heroes had begun to snore , On which he slyly took himself away , The road he came , and ere 'twas break of day ; The girl soon follow 'd , since she justly fear 'd , Still more fatigues : -- so off she quickly steer 'd , AT length when both the nobles were awake ; Astolphus said , my friend you rest should take , ` Twere better till to-morrow keep in bed , Since sleep , with such fatigues , of course has fled : You talk at random , cried the Roman youth ; More rest I fancy you require in truth ; You 've led a pretty life throughout the night ; I ? said the king ; why I was weary quite , So long I waited ; you no respite gave , But wholly seem 'd our little nymph t ' enslave ; At length to try if I from rage could keep , I turn 'd my back once more , and went to sleep . If you had willingly the belle resign 'd , I was , my friend , to take a turn inclin 'd ; That had sufficed for me , since I , like you , Perpetual motion never can pursue . YOUR raillery , the Roman youth replied , Quite disconcerted , pray now lay aside , And talk of something else ; you 've fully shown , That I 'm your vassal , and since you are grown So fond that you to keep the girl desire , E ` en wholly to yourself , why I 'll retire ; Do with her what you please , and we shall see , How long this furor will with you agree . IT may , replied the king , for ever last , If ev ` ry night like this , I 'm doom 'd to fast . SIRE , said Joconde , no longer let us thus , In terms of playful raillery discuss ; Since such your pleasure , send me from your view ; On this the youthful monarch angry grew , And many words between the friends arose ; The presence of the nymph Astolphus chose ; To her they said , between us judge , sweet fair , And every thing was stated then with care . THE girl with blushing cheeks before them kneel 'd , And the mysterious tale at once reveal 'd . Our heroes laugh 'd ; the treach ` ry vile excus 'd ; And gave the ring , which much delight diffus 'd ; Together with a handsome sum of gold , Which soon a husband in her train enroll 'd , Who , for a maid , the pretty fair-one took ; And then our heroes wand ` ring pranks forsook , With laurels cover 'd , which in future times , Will make them famous through the Western climes ; More glorious since , they only cost , we find , Those sweet ATTENTIONS pleasing to the MIND . So many conquests proud of having made , And over full the BOOK of -- those who 'd play 'd ; Said gay Astolphus we will now , my friend , Return the shortest road and poaching end ; If false our mates , yet we 'll console ourselves , That many others have inconstant elves . Perhaps , in things a change will be one day , And only tender flames LOVE 'S torch display ; But now it seems some evil star presides , And Hymen 's flock the devil surely rides . Besides , vile fiends the universe pervade , Whose constant aim is mortals to degrade , And cheat us to our noses if they can , -LRB-B- Hell 's imps in human shape , disgrace to man ! -RRB-B- Perhaps these wretches have bewitch 'd our wives , And made us fancy errors in their lives . Then let us like good citizens , our days In future pass amidst domestick ways ; Our absence may indeed restore their hearts , For jealousy oft virtuous truths imparts . IN this Astolphus certainly believ 'd ; The friends return 'd , and kindly were receiv 'd ; A little scolding first assail 'd the ear ; But blissful kisses banish 'd ev ` ry fear . To balls and banquets ALL themselves resigned ; Of dwarf or valet nothing more we find ; Each with his wife contentedly remained : -- ` Tis thus alone true happiness is gained .
