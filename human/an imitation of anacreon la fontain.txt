AN IMITATION OF ANACREON La Fontain PAINTER in Paphos and Cythera famed Depict , I pray , the absent Iris ' face . Thou hast not seen the lovely nymph I 've named ; The better for thy peace . -- Then will I trace For thy instruction her transcendent grace . Begin with lily white and blushing rose , Take then the Loves and Graces ... But what good Words , idle words ? for Beauty 's Goddess could By Iris be replaced , nor one suppose The secret fraud -- their grace so equal shows . Thou at Cythera couldst , at Paphos too , Of the same Iris Venus form anew .
