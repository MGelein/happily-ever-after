THE TRACKS IN THE SNOW Arthur Scott Bailey One fine winter 's day Fatty Coon came upon the queerest tracks in the snow . They were huge -- a great deal bigger , even , than bear-tracks , which Fatty had sometimes seen , for once in a while , before the weather grew too cold , and he fell into his winter 's sleep , a bear would come down into the valley from his home on Blue Mountain . But these were six times as big as bear tracks . And Fatty felt a shiver of fear run up and down his back . He followed the trail a little way . But he was very careful . He was always ready to scramble up a tree , in case he should suddenly see the strange animal -- or rather , in case the strange animal should see HIM . The great tracks led straight toward Farmer Green 's house . And Fatty did not want to go there . So he hurried home to ask his mother what he had found . Mrs. Coon listened to Fatty 's story . `` I think it must be the monster that almost caught me in the road last summer , '' said Fatty , meaning the automobile that had given him a great fright . `` Maybe he 's come back again to catch Farmer Green and his family ... Do you suppose he 's eaten them up ? '' Mrs. Coon was puzzled . And she was somewhat alarmed , too . She wanted to see those strange tracks herself . So she told her other children not to step a foot out of the house until she came back . And then she asked Fatty to run along and show her where he had come upon the monster 's trail . Fatty Coon felt very important , as he led the way across the swamp and into the woods . It was not often that he could show his mother anything . And he was so proud that he almost forgot his fright . `` I guess you 're glad I have sharp eyes , '' he said , as they hurried along . `` If the tracks are as big as you say they are , your eyes would n't have to be very sharp to see them , '' his mother told him . Mrs. Coon never liked to hear her children boast . She knew that boasting is one of the most unpleasant things anyone can do . `` Well -- maybe you do n't think I saw the monster 's tracks at all , '' said Fatty . `` Maybe you do n't think I heard him screech -- '' `` When did you hear him screech ? '' Mrs. Coon asked . `` This is the first you 've said about SCREECHING . When was it ? '' `` Last summer , '' Fatty answered . Mrs. Coon did n't smile . Perhaps she was too worried for that . `` It may not be the same monster , '' she said . `` It may not be a monster at all . '' But by this time Fatty was sure he was right . He was sure he knew more than his mother . `` Why ca n't we go right over to Farmer Green 's and take some of his chickens ? '' he asked . `` The monster has probably eaten him by this time , and all his family , too . '' But Mrs. Coon would do no such thing . `` Show me the tracks , '' she said firmly . And so they went on into the woods . `` There they are ! '' Fatty cried , a few minutes later . `` See , Mother ! They 're even bigger than I said . '' He heard a funny noise behind him , then . And when Fatty Coon looked around he saw that his mother was actually holding her sides , she was laughing so hard . `` Those are Farmer Green 's tracks , '' she said , as soon as she could stop laughing long enough to speak . `` What -- as big as that ? '' Fatty pointed at the huge prints in the snow . `` Snowshoes ! '' Mrs. Coon said . `` He was wearing snowshoes -- great frames made of thongs and sticks , to keep him from sinking into the snow . '' So that was all there was to Fatty 's monster . Somehow , he was disappointed . But he was very glad he had said nothing to Jasper Jay about his strange animal . For if he had , he knew he would never have heard the last of it . And Fatty was glad about another thing , too . He felt very happy that his mother had not let him go after Farmer Green 's chickens .
