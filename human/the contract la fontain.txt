THE CONTRACT La Fontain THE husband 's dire mishap , and silly maid , In ev ` ry age , have proved the fable 's aid ; The fertile subject never will be dry : ` Tis inexhaustible , you may rely . No man 's exempt from evils such as these : -- Who thinks himself secure , but little sees . One laughs at sly intrigues who , ere ` tis long , May , in his turn , be sneered at by the throng : With such vicissitudes , to be cast down , AppearsS rank nonsense worthy Folly 's crown . He , whose adventures I 'm about to write , In his mischances , -- found what gave delight . A CERTAIN Citizen , with fortune large , When settled with a handsome wife in charge , Not long attended for the marriage fruit : The lady soon put matters ` yond dispute ; Produced a girl at first , and then a boy , To fill th ' expecting parent 's breast with joy . THE son , when grown of size , a tutor had , No pedant rude , with Greek and Latin mad , But young and smart , a master too of arts , Particularly learned in what imparts , The gentle flame , the pleasing poignant pang , That Ovid formerly so sweetly sang . Some knowledge of good company he 'd got ; A charming voice and manner were his lot ; And if we may disclose the mystick truth , 'Twas Cupid who preceptor made the youth . He with the brother solely took a place , That better he the sister 's charms might trace ; And under this disguise he fully gained What he desired , so well his part he feigned : An able master , or a lover true , To teach or sigh , whichever was in view , So thoroughly he could attention get , Success alike in ev ` ry thing he met . IN little time the boy could construe well The odes of Horace : -- Virgil 's fable tell ; And she whose beauty caught the tutor 's eyes , A perfect mistress got of heaving sighs . So oft she practiced what the master taught , Her stomach feeble grew , whate'er was sought ; And strange suspicions of the cause arose , Which Time at length was driven to disclose . MOST terribly the father raged and swore ; Our learned master , frightened , left the door , The lady wished to take the youth for life ; The spark desired to make the girl his wife ; Both had the Hymeneal knot in view , And mutual soft affection fondly knew . At present love is little more than name : In matrimony , gold 's the only aim . The belle was rich , while he had nothing got ; For him 'twas great : -- for her a narrow lot . O DIRE corruption , age of wretched ways ! What strange caprice such management displays ! Shall we permit this fatal pow ` r to reign ? Base int ` rest 's impulse : hideous modern stain ; The curse of ev ` ry tender soft delight , That charms the soul and fascinates the sight . BUT truce to moral ; let 's our tale resume ; The daughter scared ; the father in a fume ; What could be done the evil to repair , And hide the sad misfortune of the fair ? What method seek ? -- They married her in haste ; But not to him who had the belle debased , For reasons I 've sufficiently detailed ; To gain her hand a certain wight prevailed , Who store of riches relished far above The charms of beauty , warmed with fondest love . Save this the man might well enough be thought : In family and wealth just what was sought ; But whether fool or not , I can not trace , Since he was unacquainted with the case ; And if he 'd known it , was the bargain bad ? Full twenty thousand pounds he with her had A sprightly youthful wife to ease his care , And with him ev ` ry luxury to share . HOW many tempted by the golden ore , Have taken wives whose slips they know before ; And this good man the lady chaste believed , So truly well she managed and deceived . But when four months had passed , the fair-one showed . How very much she to her lessons owed ; A little girl arrived : the husband stared Cried he , what father of a child declared ! The time 's too short : four months ! I 'm taken in ! A family should not so soon begin . AWAY he to the lady 's father flew , And of his shame a horrid picture drew ; Proposed to be divorced : much rage disclosed ; The parent smiled and said , pray be composed ; Speak not so loud : we may be overheard , And privacy is much to be preferred . A son-in-law , like you , I once appeared , And similar misfortune justly feared ; Complaint I made , and mentioned a divorce ; Of heat and rage the ordinary course . THE father of my wife , who 's now no more , -LRB-B- Heav ` n guard his soul , the loss I oft deplore , -RRB-B- A prudent honest man as any round , To calm my mind , a nice specifick found ; The pill was rather bitter , I admit ; But gilding made it for the stomach fit , Which he knew how to manage very well : No doctor in it him could e ` er excel ; To satisfy my scruples he displayed A CONTRACT -LRB-B- duly stamped and ably made -RRB-B- , Four thousand to secure , which he had got , On similar occasion for a blot ; His lady 's father gave it to efface Domestick diff ` rences and like disgrace : With this my spouse 's fortune he increased ; And instantly my dire complaining ceased . From family to family the deed Should pass , ` twill often prove a useful meed ; I kept it for the purpose : -- do the same Your daughter , married , may have equal blame . On this the son-in-law the bond received , And , with a bow , departed much relieved . MAY Heav ` n preserve from trouble those who find , At cheaper rate , to be consoled inclined .
