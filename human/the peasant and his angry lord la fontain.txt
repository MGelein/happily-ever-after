THE PEASANT AND HIS ANGRY LORD La Fontain ONCE on a time , as hist ` ry 's page relates , A lord , possessed of many large estates , Was angry with a poor and humble clod , Who tilled his grounds and feared his very nod . Th ' offence -LRB-B- as often happens -RRB-B- was but small , But on him , vowed the peer , his rage should fall -- Said he , a halter , rascal , you deserve ; You 'll never from the gallows-turnpike swerve : Or , soon or late you swinging will be found Who , born for hanging , ever yet was drowned ? Howe'er you 'll smile to hear my lenient voice ; Observe , three punishments await your choice ; Take which you will . -- The first is , you shall eat , Of strongest garlick , thirty heads complete ; No drink you 'll have between , nor sleep , nor rest ; You know a breach of promise I detest . Or , on your shoulders further I propose , To give you , with a cudgel , thirty blows . Or , if more pleasing , that you truly pay , The sum of thirty pounds without delay . THE peasant ` gan to turn things in his mind : -- Said he , to take the heads I 'm not inclined ; No drink , you say , between ; that makes it worse ; To eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse . Nor can I suffer on my tender back , That , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack . Still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared ; Uncertain how to act , he hanging feared . The noble peer he begged , upon his knees , His penitence to hear , and sentence ease . But mercy dwelled not with the angry lord Is this , cried he , the answer ? -- bring a cord . The peasant , trembling lest his life was sought ; The garlick chose , which presently was brought . UPON a dish my lord the number told ; Clod no way liked the garlick to behold . With piteous mien the garlick head he took , Then on it num ` rous ways was led to look , And grumbling much , began to spit and eat , just like a cat with mustard on her meat , To touch it with his tongue he durst not do ; He knew not how to act or what pursue . The peer , delighted at the man 's distress , The garlick made him bite , and chew , and press , Then gulp it down as if delicious fare ; The first he passed ; the second made him swear ; The third he found was every whit as sad , He wished the devil had it , 'twas so bad . In short , when at the twelfth our wight arrived , He thought his mouth and throat of skin deprived . Said he , some drink I earnestly intreat ; What , Greg ` ry , cried my lord , dost feel a heat ; In thy repasts dost love to wet thy jaws ? Well ! well ! I wo n't object ; thou know ` st my laws ; Much good may ` t do thee ; here , some wine , some wine ! Yet recollect , to drink , since you design , That afterward , my friend , you 'll have to choose The thirty blows , or thirty pounds to lose . But , cried the peasant , I sincerely pray , Your lordship 's goodness , that the garlick may Be taken in the account , for as to pelf , Where can an humble lab ` rer , like myself , Expect the sum of thirty pounds to seize ? Then , said the peer , be cudgelled if you please ; Take thirty thwacks ; for naught the garlick goes . To moisten well his throat , and ease his woes , The peasant drank a copious draught of wine , And then to bear the cudgel would resign . A SINGLE blow he patiently endured ; The second , howsoe'er , his patience cured ; The third was more severe , and each was worse ; The punishment he now began to curse ; Two lusty wights , with cudgels thrashed his back And regularly gave him thwack and thwack ; He cried , he roared , for grace he begged his lord , Who marked each blow , and would no ease accord ; But carefully observed , from time to time , That lenity he always thought sublime ; His gravity preserved ; considered too The blows received and what continued due . AT length , when Greg ` ry twenty strokes had got , He piteously exclaimed : -- if more 's my lot I never shall survive ! Oh ! pray forgive , If you desire , my lord , that I should live . Then down with thirty pounds , replied the peer , Since you the blows so much pretend to fear ; I 'm sorry for you ; but if all the gold Be not prepared , your godfather , I 'm told , Can lend a part ; yet , since so far you 've been , To flinch the rest you surely wo n't be seen . THE wretched peasant to his lordship flew , And trembling cried -- ` tis up ! the number view ! A scrutiny was made , which nothing gained ; No choice but pay the money now remained ; This grieved him much , and o ` er the fellow 's face ; The dewy drops were seen to flow apace . All useless proved : -- the full demand he sent , With which the peer expressed himself content . Unlucky he whoe'er his lord offends ! To golden ore , howe'er , the proud man bends : 'TWAS vain that Gregory a pardon prayed ; For trivial faults the peasant dearly paid ; His throat enflamed -- his tender back well beat -- His money gone -- and all to make complete , Without the least deduction for the pain , The blows and garlick gave the trembling swain .
