THE TWO FRIENDS La Fontain AXIOCHUS , a handsome youth of old , And Alcibiades , -LRB-B- both gay and bold , -RRB-B- So well agreed , they kept a beauteous belle , With whom by turns they equally would dwell . IT happened , one of them so nicely played , The fav ` rite lass produced a little maid , Which both extolled , and each his own believed , Though doubtless one or t ` other was deceived . BUT when to riper years the bantling grew , And sought her mother 's foot-steps to pursue , Each friend desired to be her chosen swain , And neither would a parent 's name retain . SAID one , why brother , she 's your very shade ; The features are the same - : - your looks pervade . Oh no , the other cried , it can not be Her chin , mouth , nose , and eyes , with your 's agree ; But that as ` twill , let me her favors win , And for the pleasure I will risk the sin .
