THE COUNTRYMAN WHO SOUGHT HIS CALF La Fontain A COUNTRYMAN , one day , his calf had lost , And , seeking it , a neighbouring forest crossed ; The tallest tree that in the district grew , He climbed to get a more extensive view . Just then a lady with her lover came ; The place was pleasing , both to spark and dame ; Their mutual wishes , looks and eyes expressed , And on the grass the lady was caressed . At sights of charms , enchanting to the eyes , The gay gallant exclaimed , with fond surprise : -- Ye gods , what striking beauties now I see ! No objects named ; but spoke with anxious glee . The clod , who , on the tree had mounted high , And heard at ease the conversation nigh , Now cried : -- Good man ! who see with such delight ; Pray tell me if my calf be in your sight ?
