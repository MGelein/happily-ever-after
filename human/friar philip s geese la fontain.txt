FRIAR PHILIP 'S GEESE La Fontain IF these gay tales give pleasure to the FAIR , The honour 's great conferred , I 'm well aware ; Yet , why suppose the sex my pages shun ? Enough , if they condemn where follies run ; Laugh in their sleeve at tricks they disapprove , And , false or true , a muscle never move . A playful jest can scarcely give offence : Who knows too much , oft shows a want of sense . From flatt ` ry oft more dire effects arise , Enflame the heart and take it by surprise ; Ye beauteous belles , beware each sighing swain , Discard his vows : -- my book with care retain ; Your safety then I 'll guarantee at ease . -- But why dismiss ? -- their wishes are to please : And , truly , no necessity appears For solitude : -- consider well your years . I HAVE , and feel convinced they do you wrong , Who think no virtue can to such belong ; White crows and phoenixes do not abound ; But lucky lovers still are sometimes found ; And though , as these famed birds , not quite so rare , The numbers are not great that favors share ; I own my works a diff ` rent sense express , But these are tales : -- mere tales in easy dress . To beauty 's wiles , in ev ` ry class , I 've bowed ; Fawned , flattered , sighed , e ` en constancy have vowed What gained ? you ask -- but little I admit ; Howe'er we aim , too oft we fail to hit . My latter days I 'll now devote with care , To guard the sex from ev ` ry latent snare . Tales I 'll detail , and these relate at ease : Narrations clear and neat will always please ; Like me , to this attention criticks pay ; Then sleep , on either side , from night till day . If awkward , vulgar phrase intervene , Or rhymes imperfect o ` er the page be seen , Condemn at will ; but stratagems and art , Pass , shut your eyes , who 'd heed the idle part ? Some mothers , husbands , may perhaps be led , To pull my locks for stories white or red ; So matters stand : a fine affair , no doubt , And what I 've failed to do -- my book makes out . THE FAIR my pages safely may pursue , And this apology they 'll not refuse . What recompense can I presume to make ? A tale I 'll give , where female charms partake , And prove resistless whatsoe'er assail : Blessed BEAUTY , NATURE ever should prevail . HAD Fate decreed our YOUTH , at early morn , To view the angel features you adorn , The captivating pow ` rs AURORA bless , Or airy SPRING bedecked in beauteous dress , And all the azure canopy on high Had vanished like a dream , once you were nigh . And when his eyes at length your charms beheld , His glowing breast with softest passion swelled ; Superior lustre beamed at ev ` ry view ; No pleasures pleased : his soul was fixed on you . Crowns , jewels , palaces , appeared as naught . 'Twas solely beauteous woman now he sought . A WOOD , from earliest years , his home had been , And birds the only company he 'd seen , Whose notes harmonious often lulled his care , Beguiled his hours , and saved him from despair ; Delightful sounds ! from nightingale and dove Unknown their tongue , yet indicant of love . THIS savage , solitary , rustick school , The father chose his infancy to rule . The mother 's recent death induced the sire , To place the son where only beasts retire ; And long the forest habitants alone Were all his youthful sight had ever known . TWO reasons , good or bad , the father led To fly the world : -- all intercourse to dread Since fate had torn his lovely spouse from hence ; Misanthropy and fear o ` ercame each sense ; Of the world grown tired , he hated all around : -- Too oft in solitude is sorrow found . His partner 's death produced distaste of life , And made him fear to seek another wife . A hermit 's gloomy , mossy cell he took , And wished his child might thither solely look . AMONG the poor his little wealth he threw , And with his infant son alone withdrew ; The forest 's dreary wilds concealed his cell ; There Philip -LRB-B- such his name -RRB-B- resolved to dwell . BY holy motives led , and not chagrin , The hermit never spoke of what he 'd seen ; But , from the youth 's discernment , strove to hide , Whate'er regarded love , and much beside , The softer sex , with all their magick charms , That fill the feeling bosom with alarms . As years advanced , the boy with care he taught ; What suited best his age before him brought ; At five he showed him animals and flow ` rs , The birds of air , the beasts , their sev ` ral pow ` rs ; And now and then of hell he gave a hint , Old Satan 's wrath , and what might awe imprint , How formed , and doomed to infamy below ; In childhood FEAR 's the lesson first we know ! THE years had passed away , when Philip tried , In matters more profound his son to guide ; He spoke of Paradise and Heav ` n above ; But not a word of woman , -- nor of LOVE . Fifteen arrived , the sire with anxious care , Of NATURE 'S works declaimed , -- but not the FAIR : An age , when those , for solitude designed , Should be to scenes of seriousness confined , Nor joys of youth , nor soft ideas praised The flame soon spreads when Cupid 's torch is raised . AT length , when twenty summers time had run , The father to the city brought his son ; With years weighed down , the hermit scarcely knew His daily course of duty to pursue ; And when Death 's venomed shaft should on him fall ; On whom could then his boy for succor call ? How life support , unknowing and unknown ? Wolves , foxes , bears , ne'er charity have shown ; And all the sire could give his darling care , A staff and wallet , he was well aware Fine patrimony , truly , for a child ! To which his mind was no way reconciled . Bread few , 'twas clear , the hermit would deny , And rich he might have been you may rely ; When he drew near , the children quickly cried Here 's father Philip -- haste , the alms provide ; And many pious men his friends were found , But not one female devotee around : None would he hear ; the FAIR he always fled Their smiles and wiles the friar kept in dread . OUR hermit , when he thought his darling youth ; Well fixed in duty and religious truth , Conveyed him ` mong his pious friends , to learn How food to beg , and other ways discern . In tears he viewed his son the forest quit , And fain would have him for the world unfit . THE city 's palaces and lofty spires , Our rustick 's bosom filled with new desires . The prince 's residence great splendor showed , And lively pleasure on the youth bestowed . What 's here ? said he ; The court , his friends replied : -- What there ? -- The mansions where the great reside : -- And these ? -- Fine statues , noble works of art : All gave delight and gratitude his heart . But when the beauteous FAIR first caught his view , To ev ` ry other sight he bade adieu ; The palace , court , or mansions he admired , No longer proved the objects he desired ; Another cause of admiration rose , His breast pervaded , and disturbed repose . What 's this , he cried , so elegantly neat ? O tell me , father ; make my joy complete ! WHAT gave the son such exquisite delight , The parent filled with agonizing fright . To answer , howsoe'er he 'd no excuse , So told the youth -- a bird they call a goose . O BEAUTEOUS bird , exclaimed th ' enraptured boy , Sing , sound thy voice , ` twill fill my soul with joy ; To thee I 'd anxiously be better known ; O father , let me have one for my own ! A thousand times I fondly ask the boon ; Let 's take it to the woods : ` tis not too soon ; Young as it is , I 'll feed it morn and night , And always make it my supreme delight .
