THE NIGHTINGALE La Fontain NO easy matter ` tis to hold , Against its owner 's will , the fleece Who troubled by the itching smart Of Cupid 's irritating dart , Eager awaits some Jason bold To grant release . E ` en dragon huge , or flaming steer , When Jason 's loved will cause no fear . Duennas , grating , bolt and lock , All obstacles can naught avail ; Constraint is but a stumbling block ; For youthful ardor must prevail . Girls are precocious nowadays , Look at the men with ardent gaze , And longings ' an infinity ; Trim misses but just in their teens By day and night devise the means To dull with subtlety to sleep The Argus vainly set to keep In safety their virginity . Sighs , smiles , false tears , they 'll fain employ An artless lover to decoy . I 'll say no more , but leave to you , Friend reader , to pronounce if true What I 've asserted when you have heard How artful Kitty , caged her bird . IN a small town in Italy , The name of which I do not know , Young Kitty dwelt , gay , pretty , free , Varambon 's child . -- Boccacio Omits her mother 's name , which not To you or me imports a jot . At fourteen years our Kitty 's charms Were all that could be wished -- plump arms , A swelling bosom ; on her cheeks RosesS ' and lilies ' mingled streaks , A sparkling eye -- all these , you know , Speak well for what is found below . With such advantages as these No virgin sure could fail to please , Or lack a lover ; nor did Kate ; But little time she had to wait ; One soon appeared to seal her fate . Young Richard saw her , loved her , wooed her -- What swain I ask could have withstood her ? Soft words , caresses , tender glances , The battery of love 's advances , Soon lit up in the maiden 's breast The flame which his own heart possessed , Soon growing to a burning fire Of love and mutual desire . Desire for what ? My reader knows , Or if he does not may suppose , And not be very wond ` rous wise . When youthful lovers mingle sighs , Believe me , friend , I am not wrong , For one thing only do they long . One check deferred our lover 's bliss , A thing quite natural , 'twas this : The mother loved so well her child That , fearful she might be beguiled , She would not let her out of sight , A single minute , day or night . At mother 's apron string all day Kate whiled the weary hours away , And shared her bed all night . Such love In parents we must all approve , Though Catherine , I must confess , In place of so much tenderness More liberty would have preferred . To little girls maternal care In such excess is right and fair , But for a lass of fourteen years , For whom one need have no such fears , Solicitude is quite absurd , And only bores her . Kitty could No moment steal , do what she would , To see her Richard . Sorely vexed She was , and he still more perplexed . In spite of all he might devise A squeeze , a kiss , quick talk of eyes Was all he could obtain , no more . Bread butterless , a sanded floor , It seemed no better . Joy like this Could not suffice , more sterling bliss Our lovers wished , nor would stop short Till they 'd obtained the thing they sought . And thus it came about . One day By chance they met , alone , away From jealous parents . `` What 's the use ; '' Said Richard , `` of all our affection ? `` Of love it is a rank abuse , `` And yields me nothing but dejection `` I see you without seeing you , `` Must always look another way , `` And if we meet I dare not stay , `` Must ev ` ry inclination smother . `` I ca n't believe your love is true ; `` I 'll never own you really kind `` Unless some certain means you find `` For us to meet without your mother . '' Kate answered : `` Were it not too plain `` How warm my love , another strain `` I would employ . In converse vain `` Let us not waste our moments few ; `` But think what it were best to do . '' `` If you will please me , '' Robert said , `` You must contrive to change your bed , `` And have it placed -- well , let me see -- `` Moved to the outer gallery , `` Where you will be alone and free . `` We there can meet and chat at leisure `` While others sleep , nor need we fear , `` Of merry tales I have a treasure `` To tell , but can not tell them here . '' Kate smiled at this for she knew well What sort of tales he had to tell ; But promised she would do her best And soon accomplish his request . It was not easy , you 'll admit , But love lends foolish maidens wit ; And this is how she managed it . The whole night long she kept awake , Snored , sighed and kicked , as one possessed , That parents both could get not rest , So much she made the settle shake . This is not strange . A longing girl , With thoughts of sweetheart in her head , In bed all night will sleepless twirl . A flea is in her ear , ` tis said . The morning broke . Of fleas and heat Kitty complained . `` Let me entreat , `` O mother , I may put my bed `` Out in the gallery , '' she said , '' ` Tis cooler there , and Philomel `` Who warbles in the neigh ` bring dell `` Will solace me . '' Ready consent The simple mother gave , and went To seek her spouse . `` Our Kate , my dear , `` Will change her bed that she may hear `` The nightingale , and sleep more cool . '' `` Wife , '' said the good man , `` You 're a fool , `` And Kate too with her nightingale ; `` Do n't tell me such a foolish tale . `` She must remain . No doubt to-night `` Will fresher be . I sleep all right `` In spite of heat , and so can she . `` Is she more delicate than me ? '' Incensed was Kate by this denial After so promising a trial , Nor would be beat , but firmly swore To give more trouble than before . That night again no wink she slept But groaned and fretted , sighed and wept , Upon her couch so tossed and turned , The anxious mother quite concerned Again her husband sought . `` Our Kate `` To me seems greatly changed of late . `` You are unkind , '' she said to him , `` To thwart her simple , girlish whim . `` Why may she not her bed exchange , `` In naught will it the house derange ? `` Placed in the passage she 's as near `` To us as were she lying here . `` You do not love your child , and will `` With your unkindness make her ill. '' `` Pray cease , '' the husband cried , `` to scold `` And take your whim . I ne'er could hold `` My own against a screaming wife ; `` You 'll drive me mad , upon my life . `` Her belly-full our Kate may get `` Of nightingale or of linnet . '' The thing was settled . Kate obeyed , And in a trice her bed was made , And lover signalled . Who shall say How long to both appeared that day , That tedious day ! But night arrived And Richard too ; he had contrived By ladder , and a servant 's aid , To reach the chamber of the maid . To tell how often they embraced , How changed in form their tenderness , Would lead to nothing but a waste Of time , my readers will confess . The longest , most abstruse discourse Would lack precision , want the force Their youthful ardor to portray . To understand there 's but one way -- Experience . The nightingale Sang all night long his pleasing tale , And though he made but little noise , The lass was satisfied . Her joys So exquisite that she averred The other nightingale , the bird Who warbles to the woods his bliss , Was but an ass compared with this . But nature could not long maintain Of efforts such as these the strain ; Their forces spent , the lovers twain In fond embrace fell fast asleep Just as the dawn began to peep : The father as he left his bed By curiosity was led To learn if Kitty soundly slept , And softly to the passage crept . `` I 'll see the influence , '' he said , `` Of nightingale and change of bed . '' With bated breath , upon tip toes , Close to the couch he cautious goes Where Kitty lay in calm repose . Excessive heat had made all clothes Unbearable . The sleeping pair Had cast them off , and lay as bare As our first happy parents were In Paradise . But in the place Of apple , in her willing hand Kate firmly grasp the magic wand Which served to found the human race , The which to name were a disgrace , Though dames the most refined employ it ; Desire it , and much enjoy it , If good Catullus tells us true . The father scarce believed his view , But keeping in his bosom pent His anger , to his wife he went , And said , `` Get up , and come with me . `` At present I can plainly see `` Why Kate had such anxiety `` To hear the nightingale , for she `` To catch the bird so well has planned `` That now she holds him in her hand . '' The mother almost wept for glee . `` A nightingale , oh ! let me see . `` How large is he , and can he sing , `` And will he breed , the pretty thing ? `` How did she catch him , clever child ? '' Despite his grief the good man smiled . `` Much more than you expect you 'll see . `` But hold your tongue , and come with me ; `` For if your chattering is heard , `` Away will fly the timid bird ; `` And you will spoil our daughter 's game . '' Who was surprised ? It was the dame . Her anger burst into a flame As she the nightingale espied Which Kitty held ; she could have cried , And scolded , called her nasty slut , And brazen hussey , bitch , and -- but Her husband stopped her . `` What 's the use `` Of all your scolding and abuse ? `` The mischief 's done , in vain may you `` From now till doomsday fret and stew , `` Misfortune done you ca n't undo , `` But something may be done to mend : `` For notary this instant send , `` Bid holy priest and mayor attend . `` For their good offices I wait `` To set this nasty matter straight . '' As he discoursed , Richard awoke , And seeing that the sun had broke , These troubled words to Kitty spoke `` Alas , my love , ` tis broad day light , `` How can I now effect my flight ? '' `` All will go well , '' rejoined the sire , `` I will not grumble , my just ire `` Were useless here ; you have committed `` A wrong of which to be acquitted , `` Richard , there is one only way , `` My child you wed without delay . `` She 's well brought up , young , full of health `` If fortune has not granted wealth , `` Her beauty you do not deny , `` So wed her , or prepare to die . '' To hesitate in such a case Would surely have been out of place The girl he loved to take to wife , Or in his prime to lose his life , The point in truth needs no debate , Nor did our Richard hesitate . Besides , the most supreme delight Of life he 'd tasted one short night , But one , in lovely Kitty 's arms ; Could he so soon resign her charms ! While Richard , pleased with his escape From what he feared an awkward scrape , Was dreaming of his happy choice , Our Kitty , by her father 's voice Awakened , from her hand let go The cause of all her joy and woe , And round her naked beauties wound The sheet picked up from off the ground : Meanwhile the notary appears To put an end to all their fears . They wrote , they signed , the sealed -- and thus The wedding ended free from fuss . They left the happy couple there . His satisfaction to declare , Thus spoke their father to the pair : `` Take courage , children , have no care ; `` The nightingale in cage is pent , `` May sing now to his heart 's content . ''
