THE CASE OF CONSCIENCE La Fontain THOSE who in fables deal , bestow at ease Both names and titles , freely as they please . It costs them scarcely any thing , we find . And each is nymph or shepherdess designed ; Some e ` en are goddesses , that move below , From whom celestial bliss of course must flow . THIS Horace followed , with superior art : -- If , to the trav ` ller 's bed , with throbbing heart , The chambermaid approached , 'twas Ilia found , Or fair Egeria , or some nymph renowned . GOD , in his goodness , made , one lovely day , Apollo , who directs the lyrick lay , And gave him pow ` rs to call and name at will , Like father Adam , with primordial skill . Said he , go , names bestow that please the ear ; In ev ` ry word let sweetest sound appear . This ancient law then proves , by right divine , WE oft are sponsors to the royal line . WHEN pleasing tales and fables I endite , I , who in humble verse presume to write , May surely use this privilege of old , And , to my fancy , appellations mould . If I , instead of Anne , should Sylvia say , And Master Thomas -LRB-B- when the case I weigh -RRB-B- Should change to Adamas , the druid sage , Must I a fine or punishment engage ? No , surely not : -- at present I shall choose Anne and the Parson for my tale to use . WITHIN her village , Anne was thought the belle , And ev ` ry other charmer to excel . As near a river once she chanced to stray , She saw a youth in Nature 's pure array , Who bathed at ease within the gliding stream ; The girl was brisk , and worthy of esteem , Her eyes were pleased ; the object gave delight ; Not one defect could be produced in sight ; Already , by the shepherdess adored , If with the belle to pleasing flights he 'd soared , The god of love had all they wished concealed None better know what should not be revealed . Anne nothing feared : the willows were her shade , Which , like Venetian blinds , a cov ` ring made ; Her eyes , howe'er , across had easy view , And , o ` er the youth , each beauty could pursue . SHE back four paces drew , at first , through shame ; Then , led by LOVE , eight others forward came ; But scruples still arose that ardor foiled , And nearly ey ` ry thing had truly spoiled . Anne had a conscience pure as holy fire ; But how could she abstain from soft desire ? If , in the bosom chance a flame should raise , Is there a pow ` r can then subdue the blaze ? At first these inclinations she withstood ; But doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood Could sins commit by stepping in advance , She took her seat upon the green expanse , And there attentively the lad observed , With eyes that scarcely from him ever swerved . PERHAPS you 've seen , from Nature , drawings made ? Some Eve , or Adam , artists then persuade , In birth-attire to stand within their view , While they with care and taste each trait pursue ; And , like our shepherdess , their stations take , A perfect semblance ev ` ry way to make . ANNE in her mem ` ry now his image placed ; Each line and feature thoroughly she traced , And even now the fair would there remain , If William -LRB-B- so was called this youthful swain -RRB-B- Had not the water left ; when she retired , Though scarcely twenty steps from him admired , Who , more alert than usual then appeared , And , by the belle , in silence was revered . WHEN such sensations once were in the breast , Love there we may believe would hardly rest . THE favors Anne reserved he thought his own , Though expectations oft away have flown . The more of this I think , the less I know ; Perhaps one half our bliss to chance we owe ! BE this as ` twill , the conscientious Anne Would nothing venture to regale her man ; Howe'er , she stated what had raised her fear , And ev ` ry thing that made her persevere . WHEN Easter came , new difficulties rose Then , in confession , ALL she should disclose . Anne , passing peccadillos in review , This case aside , as an intruder threw ; But parson Thomas made her all relate ; And ev ` ry circumstance most clearly state ; That he , by knowing fully each defect , Might punishment accordingly direct , In which no father-confessor should err , Who absolution justly would confer . The parson much his penitent abused ; Said he , with sensual views to be amused , Is such a sin , ` tis scarcely worse to steal ; The sight is just the same as if you feel . HOWE ` ER , the punishment that he imposed Was nothing great : -- too slight to be disclosed ; Enough to say , that in the country round , The father-confessors , who there abound , As in our own , -LRB-B- perhaps in ev ` ry part , -RRB-B- Have devotees , who , when they ought to smart , A tribute pay , according to their lot , And thus indulgences are often got . THIS tribute to discharge the current year , Much troubled Anne , and filled her breast with fear , When William , fishing , chanced a pike to hook , And gave it to his dear at once to cook , Who , quite delighted , hastened to the priest , And begged his rev ` rence on the fish to feast . The parson with the present much was pleased ; A tap upon the shoulder care appeased ; And with a smile he to the bringer said This fish , with trifles on the table spread , Will all complete ; 'twas holyday we find , When other clergy with our rector dined . Will you still more oblige , the parson cried , And let the fish at home by you be fried ? Then bring it here : -- my servant 's very new , And ca n't attempt to cook as well as you . Anne hastened back ; meanwhile the priests arrived , Much noise , and rout of course , once these were hived ; Wines from the vault were brought without delay ; Each of the quality would something say . THE dinner served ; the dean at table placed ; Their conversation various points embraced ; To state the whole would clearly endless be ; In this no doubt the reader will agree . They changed and changed , and healths went round and round ; No time for scandal while such cheer was found ; The first and second course away were cleared , Dessert served up , yet still no pike appeared . The dinner o ` er without th ' expected dish , Or even a shadow of the promised fish . When William learned the present Anne had made , His wish , to have it canceled , with her weighed . The rector was surprised , you may suppose , And , soon as from the table all arose , He went to Anne , and called her fool and knave , And , in his wrath , could scarcely secrets wave , But nearly her reproached the bathing scene ; What , treat , said he , your priest like base and mean ? ANNE archly answered , with expression neat : -- The sight is just the same as if you eat !
