THE EAR-MAKER AND THE MOULD-MENDER La Fontain WHEN William went from home -LRB-B- a trader styled -RRB-B- : Six months his better half he left with child , A simple , comely , modest , youthful dame , Whose name was Alice ; from Champaign she came . Her neighbor Andrew visits now would pay ; With what intention , needless ` tis to say : A master who but rarely spread his net , But , first or last , with full success he met ; And cunning was the bird that ` scaped his snare ; Without surrendering a feather there . QUITE raw was Alice ; for his purpose fit ; Not overburdened with a store of wit ; Of this indeed she could not be accused , And Cupid 's wiles by her were never used ; Poor lady , all with her was honest part , And naught she knew of stratagem or art . HER husband then away , and she alone , This neighbor came , and in a whining tone , To her observed , when compliments were o ` er : -- I 'm all astonishment , and you deplore , To find that neighbor William 's gone from hence , And left your child 's completing in suspense , Which now you bear within , and much I fear , That when ` tis born you 'll find it wants an ear . Your looks sufficiently the fact proclaim , For many instances I 've known the same . Good heav ` ns ! replied the lady in a fright ; What say you , pray ? -- the infant wo n't be right ! Shall I be mother to a one-eared child ? And know you no relief that 's certain styled ? Oh yes , there is , rejoined the crafty knave , From such mishap I can the baby save ; Yet solemnly I vow , for none but you I 'd undertake the toilsome job to do . The ills of others , if I may be plain , Except your husband 's , never give me pain ; But him I 'd serve for ever , while I 've breath ; To do him good I 'd e ` en encounter death . Now let us see , without more talk or fears , If I know how to forge the bantling ears . Remember , cried the wife , to make them like . Leave that to me , said he , I 'll justly strike . Then he prepared for work ; the dame gave way ; Not difficult she proved : -- well pleased she lay ; Philosophy was never less required , And Andrew 's process much the fair admired , Who , to his work extreme attention paid ; 'Twas now a tendon ; then a fold he made , Or cartilage , of which he formed enough , And all without complaining of the stuff . To-morrow we will polish it , said he : Then in perfection soon the whole will be ; And from repeating this so oft , you 'll get As perfect issue as was ever met . I 'm much obliged to you , the wife replied , A friend is good in whom we may confide . NEXT day , when tardy Time had marked the hour ; That Andrew hoped again to use his pow ` r , He was not plunged in sleep , but briskly flew , His purpose with the charmer to pursue . Said he , all other things aside I 've laid , This ear to finish , and to lend you aid . And I , the dame replied , was on the eve , To send and beg you not the job to leave ; Above stairs let us go : -- away they ran , And quickly recommenced as they began . The work so oft was smoothed , that Alice showed Some scruples lest the ear he had bestowed Should do too much , and to the wily wight , She said , so little you the labor slight , ` Twere well if ears no more than two appear ; Of that , rejoined the other , never fear ; I 've guarded thoroughly against defects , Mistake like that shall ne'er your senses vex . THE ear howe'er was still in hand the same , When from his journey home the husband came . Saluted Alice , who with anxious look , Exclaimed , -- your work how finely you forsook , And , but for neighbor Andrew 's kindness here , Our child would incomplete have been -- an ear , I could not let a thing remain like this , And Andrew would not be to friends remiss , But , worthy man , he left his thriving trade , And for the babe a proper ear has made . THE husband , not conceiving how his wife , Could be so weak and ignorant of life , The circumstances made her fully tell , Repeat them o ` er and on each action dwell . Enraged at length , a pistol by the bed He seized and swore at once he 'd shoot her dead . The belle with tears replied , howe'er she 'd swerved , Such cruel treatment never she deserved . Her innocence , and simple , gentle way , At length appeared his frantick rage to lay . What injury , continued she , is done ? The strictest scrutiny I would not shun ; Your goods and money , ev ` ry thing is right ; And Andrew told me , nothing he would slight ; That you would find much more than you could want ; And this I hope to me you 'll freely grant ; If falsehood I advance , my life I 'll lose ; Your equity , I trust , will me excuse . A LITTLE cooled , then William thus replied , We 'll say no more ; you have been drawn aside ; What passed you fancied acting for the best , And I 'll consent to put the thing at rest ; To nothing good such altercations tend ; I 've but a word : to that attention lend ; Contrive to-morrow that I here entrap This fellow who has caused your sad mishap ; You 'll utter not a word of what I 've said ; Be secret or at once I 'll strike you dead . Adroitly you must act : for instance say ; I 'm on a second journey gone away ; A message or a letter to him send , Soliciting that he 'll on you attend , That something you have got to let him know ; -- To come , no doubt , the rascal wo n't be slow ; Amuse him then with converse most absurd , But of the EAR remember , -- not a word ; That 's finished now , and nothing can require ; You 'll carefully perform what I desire . Poor innocent ! the point she nicely hit ; Fear oft gives simpletons a sort of wit . THE arch gallant arrived ; the husband came Ascended to the room where sat his dame ; Much noise he made , his coming to announce ; The lover , terrified , began to bounce ; Now here , now there , no shelter could he meet ; Between the bed and wall he put his feet , And lay concealed , while William loudly knocked ; Fair Alice readily the door unlocked , And , pointing with her hand , informed the spouse , Where he might easily his rival rouse . THE husband ev ` ry way was armed so well , He four such men as Andrew could repel ; In quest of succor howsoe'er he went : To kill him surely William never meant , But only take an ear , or what the TurksS , Those savage beasts , cut off from Nature 's works ; Which doubtless must be infinitely worse Infernal practice and continual curse . 'Twas this he whispered should be Andrew 's doom , When with his easy wife he left the room ; She nothing durst reply : the door he shut , And our gallant ` gan presently to strut , Around and round , believing all was right , And William unacquainted with his plight . THE latter having well the project weighed , Now changed his plan , and other schemes surveyed ; Proposed within himself revenge to take , With less parade : -- less noise it then would make , And better fruit the action would produce , Than if he were apparently profuse . Said he to Alice , go and seek his wife ; To her relate the whole that caused our strife ; Minutely all from first to last detail ; And then the better on her to prevail , To hasten here , you 'll hint that you have fears , That Andrew risks the loss of -- more than ears , For I have punishment severe in view , Which greatly she must wish I should not do ; But if an ear-maker , like this , is caught , The worst of chastisement is always sought ; Such horrid things as scarcely can be said : They make the hair to stand upon the head ; That he 's upon the point of suff ` ring straight , And only for her presence things await ; That though she can not all proceedings stay , Perhaps she may some portion take away . Go , bring her instantly , haste quickly , run ; And , if she comes , I 'll pardon what 's been done . WITH joy to Andrew 's house fair Alice went ; The wife to follow her appeared content ; Quite out of breath , alone she ran up stairs , And , not perceiving him who shared her cares ; Believed he was imprisoned in a room ; And while with fear she trembled for his doom ; The master -LRB-B- having laid aside his arms -RRB-B- Now came to compliment the lady 's charms ; He gave the belle a chair , who looked most nice : -- Said he , ingratitude 's the worst of vice ; To me your husband has been wondrous kind ; So many services has done I find , That , ere you leave this house , I 'd wish to make A little return , and this you will partake . When I was absent from my loving dear , Obligingly he made her babe an ear . The compliment of course I must admire ; Retaliation is what I desire , And I 've a thought : -- your children all have got The nose a little short , which is a blot ; A fault within the mould no doubt 's the cause , Which I can mend , and any other flaws . The business now let 's execute I pray , On which the dame he took without delay , And placed her near where Andrew hid his head , Then ` gan to operate as he was led . THE lady patiently his process bore , And blessed her stars that Andrew 's risk was o ` er That she had thus the dire return received , And saved the man for whom her bosom grieved . So much emotion William seemed to feel , No grace he gave , but all performed with zeal ; Retaliated ev ` ry way so well , He measure gave for measure : -- ell for ell . How true the adage , that revenge is sweet ! The plan he followed clearly was discrete ; For since he wished his honor to repair : -- Of any better way I 'm not aware . THE whole without a murmur Andrew viewed , And thanked kind Heav ` n that nothing worse ensued ; One ear most readily he would have lost , Could he be certain that would pay the cost . He thought ` twould lucky be , could he get out , For all considered , better ` twere no doubt , Howe'er ridiculous the thing appears , To have a pair of horns than lose his ears .
